I ask because ""Program"" is a word in my domain and having this class in the root namespace is a headache. Any other suggestions to work around this problem are welcome.
The issue is that if you are in MyNamespace.Controller for example you automatically get the classes in MyNamespace, like Program. So the code will compile but I will have picked up the wrong class. The trouble I ran into is with EntityFramework configuration. I end up picking up the MyNamespace.Program class instead of MyNamespace.Domain.Program class on accident. The code compiles but then fails at run time. The cleanest way I figured to avoid this was to rename MyNamespace.Program to MyNamespace.ProgramLauncher.
"
45821700,45821700,154620654,"""Program"" is a word in my domain. I have a class named for my domain model. What can happen is the entry class gets picked up if I just use in my code, and do not fully qualify it via . The part that troubles me is that this can result in the application compiling and then erroring at runtime.
I am interested in solutions that keep me from compiling an application that will exception at runtime. The best solution I've thought of is renaming the MyNamespace.Program entry class to something else.
Addendum:
This question's original title was ""Can I name the .NET Core Program class something else"". Unfortunately that resulted in multiple down votes, and some surprisingly opinionated responses to what I thought was a simple question. So instead of asking that question I've rewritten this question as a description of my specific problem, hoping it might be more helpful to anyone who stumbles upon it in the future.

When these layouts are empty, no problem, they have the good proportion.

I cannot comprehend totally the use of ??. I know that here the point is that if the new element is not already into the dictionary, then is gonna be added and it'll have a value of 1. And if it already exists, then its correspondent integer values is gonna increase by 1.

46433814,46433814,157056234,"Right now I am building a distributed application and am looking into using rpc:cast vs rpc:call because I don't want the calling processes to wait on the return value, or even receive one.
Cast works perfectly for this, but I am curious, what process executes the function passed by rpc:cast and call? Should I be worried about over/under concurrency?
Usually, when I want another process executing code, I use a pool of workers and send one of them an asynchronous cast with gen_server:cast/2 and let them handle it. But for RPC, it doesn't define what process does the computation. Are the processes pre-allocated and waiting? Or is every process spawned as rpc calls it and then terminated? From what I have read, this is incredibly inefficient if you are making many calls, as the processes are just being created and destroyed which isn't computationally easy.

2.  Use function to 'convert' errors and warnings to exceptions. But there is another problem - how can I handle all possible errors? I tried to find the complete list of PHP errors and warnings, but [it doesn't exist][1].
    So I have no idea how to solve this problem, please help me.
    Thanks in advance, hope you will understand my question even with my poor English level.

51053098,51053098,176403201,"TL;DR: I want to implement unification for row polymorphism, using a , but have gotten stuck.

Background

I’m writing a compiler for a language that has an effect system which uses row polymorphism, as in Extensible Records with Scoped Labels, to represent sets of effects attached to function types. That is, in this language, the kind of the function arrow is:
Where is an effect label such as or . A simple example is the type of :
In hypothetical Haskell syntax:
This means takes a of values of type , and a function from to with a set of effects , and returns a of s, also requiring the effects . A pure function is fully polymorphic in its effect, which is defaulted to an empty row; so is pure if its functional argument is pure; otherwise it requires the same effects as its argument.
I’m experimenting with representing the type system of this language within Haskell’s type system, so that I can lean on Haskell’s typechecker to write a verified typechecker in the manner of this blog post.
However, when I get to unifying function types, I need to unify the inputs and outputs by regular unification (equality), but I need to unify the effects by row unification, which is defined like so:
This says “if can be rewritten into under substitution , and and unify under substitution , then unifies with under substitution , plus a side condition marked with a dagger (†) that I’ll explain momentarily.
The (<U+2243>) relation means that two rows are isomorphic according to the following three rules:
In my current unverified typechecker, these two functions look like this in Haskell:

When a row is unified with some row , we first try to rewrite in the form […] If this succeeds, the unification proceeds by unifying…the tail of the rows.
So given , , and , along with the unification rule, is used to assert that can be rewritten into under some substitution, failing () or returning () the tail of the rewritten row, the substitution (because it’s always empty or a singleton), and the updated type environment. We don’t actually pass because we only need its last element .
The rule: a row which already begins with the given label is trivially rewritten by the identity substitution.
The rule: a row that contains a label somewhere within it can be rewritten to place that label at the head.
The rule: when unifying with a type variable, no label is present, so we can’t directly test for equality, and must return a fresh variable for the row tail.
† This enforces the side condition that prevents unifying rows with a common tail but distinct prefixes, thereby ensuring termination even though we’re adding fresh type variables.
In any other case, the rows are not isomorphic.

What I’ve Tried

I’m attempting to translate row unification with to the type level, using a type family operating on type-level lists of types: That seems to work for basic cases: But fails on more complex cases: I believe it’s because I may have implemented the rule incorrectly (the seems suspicious), and I’m missing the rule. I’m stuck on the implementation of because I don’t know how to bring a fresh type variable into scope (or whether that’s even the right approach).

  - Is it possible to introduce a fresh variable with or something, or should I give up on trying to implement the typing rules directly and take a different approach?
  - Alternatively, is there some existing extensible-record library that specifically uses row unification (not some other method) so I can use the library or learn the technique from it?
    Note that this is not the same as simple set equality, because there may be duplicate labels, and they are “scoped” in the sense described in the paper I linked at the top of this question. This is important for two reasons: first, I intend to extend this in the future so that an effect label may have type parameters, e.g., ; and second, I intend to use this machinery to implement extensible records and variants in the language.

For instance, there's a lot of setting flags in registers:
Thankfully there are macros that hide actual port IO operations (the left hand side), so it looks like a simple assignment. But all that syntax to me is messy.
Requirements are:

  - it only has to handle up to 8 bits,
  - the bit positions must be able to be passed in any order, and
  - should only require set bits to be passed.
    The syntax I'd like is:
    SPCR = bits(SPE, SPIE, MSTR, SPI2X);
    The best I've come up with so far is a combo macro/function:
    This compiles to 32 bytes on my particular architecure and takes 61-345 cycles to execute (depends on how many bits were passed).
    Ideally this should be done in preprocessor since the result is a constant, and the output machine instructions shouldbe just an assignment of an 8 bit value to a register.

Those solutions work for those toy examples, but when I try the exact same code on my own full program, they behave very differently and I'm completely befuddled as to why. When I run the program below, the testplot.png file is just a plot of the line, without the stacked bar chart.
So here is my (full) code as cut down as I can make it. If anyone wants to critique my programming, go ahead. I know that the comments are light, but that's to try to shorten it for this post. Also, this does actually download the USDA PSD database which is about 20MB compressed and is 170MB uncompressed...sorry but I would love someone's help on this!
Edit, here are str() outputs of both 'full' data and 'toy' data. The toy data works, the full data doesn't.

1909840,1909840,3832193,"Can anyone explain why it's not possible to create your own view controller hierarchies using UIKit on the iPhone?
Let me explain: when creating applications using a complex view hierarchy and navigation logic, it's a good idea to have certain views controlled by a dedicated view controller. These controllers can have their own subcontrollers, and so on. All standard stuff really.
So why is the parentViewController property readonly? It's used by UINavigationController and UITabBarController, and many other properties rely on it (for example the navigationController property).
I've seen many people telling us to create our own property for managing view controller hierarchies, but that's a little silly when Apple's own framework uses its own private ""you can't touch it"" hierarchy model.

I have lots of small, internal applications - winforms, MVC3 sites, console/service apps etc., usually department specific.  Most departments have some ""common"" code for things they work with, and then there is general common code, such as extension methods, that are common to most projects.

An alternative could be to structure like this:

I can see that for 50 bytes array 64 bytes were allocated. It seems that it's allocating stack on 16 bytes boundary, since for 10 bytes - 16 bytes were allocated.
My questions:

1)  Is there some standard of stack alignment on 16 byte boundary for arrays?
    Cause variables like int, long int, etc. clearly aren't allocated on 16 byte boundary.
2)  Why arrays allocated in such a weird way? We can see for array , 14 bytes that were added as alignment padding right after our payload of 50 bytes, but for array , 6 alignment bytes are allocated before our payload of 10 bytes. Am i missing something?
3)  Why function argument passed in (), placed on stack 4 bytes away from our arrays memory beginning(including padding). So byte variables() are also padded or something? Why 4 bytes?

14378339,14378339,34595578,"To simplify the question, I will describe a simplified use case:
Let's say I have a top level Grid that contains 1 dynamic inner Grid and a ListBox that fits in certain cells of the top level Grid:

1.  The top level Grid structure (TopGrid.xaml) is relatively static with only dynamic size of the cell that will contain the inner Grid.
2.  The inner Grid structure is dynamic, there are many/unkown kind of contents, but each kind of content is static and can be represented by a separate XAML. So I will have InnerGrid_1.xaml, InnerGrid_2.xaml, InnerGrid_n.xaml, etc.
3.  At run time, depend on the ListBox selection, certain InnerGrid should be displayed.
    I'm thinking of two ways to do it:
4.  Run time text-edit the XAML in the code:
    In the code, use XmlDocument to edit the TopGrid.xaml to add the content of certain InnerGrid_x.xaml to create the final in-memory TopGrid.xaml. Then use XamlReader to read the final TopGrid.xaml into a Visual Tree, then add the tree to LayoutRoot to show it.
5.  Visual Tree manipulation (no text edit):
    In the code, use XamlReader to read the TopGrid.xaml into a top-visual-tree, read InnerGrid_x.xaml into a sub-visual-tree. Then use VisualTreeHelper to find the TopGrid element in top-visual-tree, find the InnerGrid element in the sub-visual-tree. Then add the sub-visual-tree to the top-visual tree. Then add the combined tree to LayoutRoot show it.
    I know the first way will work but need complex XML manipulation (or text editing) in the code. I desire the second way but not sure if it will work. Especially, I will probably change the size of the cell in the TopGrid to hold the dynamic InnerGrid.
    Anybody has done this and can shed some light? or any better solution?
    A side question: Seems the dynamically loaded XAML cannot specify event handler inside XAML (my test), I need set event handler dynamically after creating the tree. Is that true?

9604973,9604973,21873836,"I am somewhat new to SSIS.
I have to deliver a 'generic' SSIS package, that the client will make multiple copies of, deploy and schedule each copy for different source databases.  I have a single SSIS Configuration table in a separate common database.  I would like to use this single configuration table  for all connections.  However the challenge is with the configuration filter.  When client makes a copy of my package, it will have the same configuration filter just like others.  I would like to give an option to the client to change the configuration filter before deploying, because for this new copy, the source database can be different.  I do not find an option to control this.
Is there a way to change the configuration filter from outside the package (without editing the executable .dtsx file)?  Or is there a better approach that I can follow?  I do not prefer XML configuration files, the primary reason being my packages are deployed onto SQL server.

It's returning false, despite the fact that I can see the date '2013-05-08' displayed in phpMyAdmin.
The table itself contains 70+ entries for that date. It always will do, if it contains any at all, but I just want to know whether it exists or not at this stage.
The date field is a MySQL 'date' type. I'm suspecting that the bug is in my structuring of the PDO calling of the query.

24057715,24057715,66655337,"I'm playing with various ajax uploaders. When analyzing their server-side code, I see something like this:
It is either muted one (like above), so does nothing (in my case) or unmuted one, so throws a warning, that access to temporary folder is prohibited (in my case) and breaks execution of a script.
What am I missing? I was always told, that we should not touch temporary files transmited via PHP form. Because this is unnecessary (and somethimes prohibited, like in my case). PHP will do all the cleaning, when script ends -- i.e. remove all uploaded temporary files.
What is the reason in code like above? Is it for the case, when script breaks, PHP is halted with some critical error and thus isn't able to remove temporary files? Or there is another reason?

The prototype is available here.
Full code here
Code contains comments of me trying to dumb down the code :). I am using the ""processing.js"" library but this shouldn't hinder anyone from understanding my code.
My specific problem is that the invaders' behaviour when moving on the X axis is not consistent and they do not always move at the same time. At first it seems like everything is fine (minus the very first invader being a bit laggy) but over time the behaviour becomes erratic and they start to move out of line.
I actually understand the flaw in my logic already, but I do not know how to solve it. However, before I explain..
I load the space invaders into a 2d array like so:
My enemy class is:
They are drawn and moved in the ""draw"" (basically processing.js's version of ""update"") loop. Like so:
Then (where the problem most likely is) I handle movement like so:
Now, I believe/know that the problem is I am interating through the arrays and checking the first and last item to monitor the X position. Therefore, there will be some lag between the program changing the direction and with it finding an object that meets the criteria of the if/else statement. (I hope that makes sense).
I have thought of somehow creating a column object with its own independent X and Y axis and to contain the invaders in there. That way I do not need to rely on individual ""invaders"" triggering the if/else statement's criteria. However, does anyone know another/easier approach or a different gap in my logic?

Also, I noticed there's a dataset.returning method but it doesn't seem to work!
Don't know if it matters but the table in question is inherited (using postgres table inheritance)
ruby 1.9.3p392 (2013-02-22) [i386-mingw32]
sequel (3.44.0)
--After a bit of troubleshooting--
Looks like the table inheritance COULD BE the problem here. Sequel seems to run a query automatically to determine the pk of a table (in my case the pk's defined on a table up the chain), not finding which, perhaps the ""returning null"" is being appended?

It looks like this was addressed in an pull request to Splat that landed since v0.3.4 hit NuGet. Following along with the notes there, I added a reference to to the iOS project. When I do, the compile errors change up to complain about too many type definitions.

17150082,17150082,42289945,"I have .net application that is compiled with 'AnyCPU' flag. This application uses MySQL for persistent storage.
I have run into a strange problem i.e. When I run my application on a 32 bit machine and hook it to 64 bit version of MySQL running on a different machine, my queries end up in state "" Waiting for table metadata lock "".
I have already tested that it works fine when both, my application and MySQL, are running on the same platform i.e. both on 32bit or both on 64bit.
Here is my theory which can be totally wrong :)
Since my application is loaded as 32 bit application, consequently the .net connector assembly (which I presume is compiled with 'anycpu') will  be loaded as 32 bit as well. My guess here is that something goes wrong when a 32bit .net connector communicates with 64bit MySQL.
Is my theory correct?
a) If no, please let me know, what would be the easiest way to find out whats going wrong?
b) if yes, what can I do about it. The reason being I can't force the .net framework to load mysql's .net connector assembly in 64bit mode for my 32bit application. Even if that was possible ( within the same process), how in the world am I going to know, before loading the connector, what type of MySQL will my application be connecting to ....?
P.S. My gut feeling is that its highly unlikely that this theory is correct as according to Google, no else has encountered this problem before.

  - Do I have to keep track of event UIDs and change their disposition based on my system's CRUD operations? Or is adding/removing/updating the events from the calendar on subsequent polling good enough for Outlook to figure it out? If I have to keep track, now I have to add a whole layer of persistence and state-awareness to my application.

This is what I did, if the linear velocity exceeded from what I need it sets the ball linear Damping to 20 if not always set it to 0.5f. This creates and effect that the gravity changes constantly and instantly.

I tried to find some property of ObjectContext that configure this behavior but didn't succeed. So my question is: Is it possible to get entities from ObjectContext we just added without need of calling ObjectContext.SaveChages() (because we don't want to commit until the business transaction ends)? If the answer is ""No"", is not this violation of the Identity Map design pattern in particular and the UnitOfWork pattern in general? And if you use EF how deal with this scenarios?

Sorry for the delay, guys.
It seems that you don't get my point. The question is not ""How to get back this instance I've just added?"" After all I have a reference to it. The question is ""How does any newly added (still uncommitted - and actually it is possible never to be committed) entity to be considered by any query over the given DbSet?""
If I add a new category and then write something like that (I'm intentionally not using repository here but row DbContext (or ObjectContext if we are using EF 4.0) to be clearer to you):
I want my new category to be returned in the result set if it satisfied the condition. Probably this query will be executed in another method (or even another class) that just share the same context (repository) within single transaction (unit of work).
I know I can execute the same query over the Categories.Local, filter the result only to newly added entities (since Local contains all entities of the set that are currently being tracked) and combine it with result returned from the database. Don't you think it's terribly ugly? And I'm not even sure if I'm not missing something right now. All this is work of the ORM. It's all about transactional behavior (unit of work) and the ORM should handle it (like NHibernate does).
Now does it make sense to you?

and the following TXT record for SenderID:

Leontx's answer appears to give an SPF record and not a SenderID record.
Also, when I look at the headers of the email I send with GAE, there are notes saying that SPF authentication passes even though I haven't added either of the above TXT records to my domain.  There is no info in the headers about SenderID.
I'm still confused about this, but I will now be using Amazon SES to send email.  It is really cheap and it seems that Amazon takes a lot more care than Google to help make sure that email gets delivered.

34732718,34732718,108215361,"Pretty much as the title says. Rendering all of the unicode format correctly what with composite characters and characters that affect other characters and ligatures is really hard, I understand that. We have fonts that seem to be designed for maximum Unicode symbol support(Symbola, Code2001, others) and specialized fonts for certain planes or character ranges(BabelStone Han, others).
I don't know much about the underlying technical details for fonts. Is there a maximum size? Is it a copyright problem? Is essentially redrawing all ~110,000 extant glyphs too hard? I understand style concerns, but why not fall back to a 'default' font that had glyphs for everything? They're on unicode.org, redrawing them all would be pretty hard work but then you'd have a guaranteed fallback font for everything. If you got rights to some pre-existing fonts you could just composite them and that should help a lot. Such a font would be a great help to humanity and I can't see a good technical reason why it doesn't exist or at least an open-source effort to create it, so I presume an invisible-to-me reason why it can't be done.
What is that reason?

  - Stop
    They are enabled/disabled according to some conditions.
    My system tray application, has a background thread does continuously check some conditions and do some work. Its main loop is below:
    gAppExit is a global variable that indicates whether user has exited from application through the 'exit' toolstripmenuitem.
    thdExit indicates whether the thread should exit from the loop (I explain it later).
    When user want to restart the background thread, he clicks on restart toolstripmenuitem and below sequence is done (Restart -> Halt -> WaitFinish):
    Note that on Halt function, it awaits thread to finish by calling Me.ThreadBgWorker.Join() on function WaitFinish.  Before calling WaitFinish function, thdExit is set to true in order to background thread can exit from main loop:
    on exit loop, ChangeStatusToStopped() is called, and it is as below:
    What it does is to enable Start toolstripmenuitem and disable restart and stop toolstripmenuitems in the UI.
    The problem is:
    Within ChangeStatusToStopped method, when MainMenu.InvokeRequired is true, it calls:
    and then it gets stuck there, that is, else body:
    is never executed. It seems like main thread is busy or some other problem in message pump.... Any ideas?

Here's a sampling of some data. The app selects random colors, alternating the hue by adding the golden ratio each time a new color is needed and then normalizing to 0..1. In the run I just did, the color created was:

Now that we have upgraded to SQL 2008 I figured it would be a great time to update these with the SQL MERGE statement. However after writing the query, the subtree cost of the MERGE statement is 1214.54! With the old way, the sum of the Insert/Update/Delete was only 0.104!!
I can't figure out how a more straightforward way of describing the same exact operation could be so much crappier. Perhaps you can see the error of my ways where I cannot.
Some stats on the table: It has 1.9 million rows, and each MERGE operation inserts, updates, or deletes more than 100 of them.  In my test case, only 1 is affected.
So how does this get to 1200 subtree cost?  The data access from the tables themselves seems to be quite efficient.  In fact, 87% of the cost of the MERGE seems to be from a Sort operation near the end of the chain:

4822732,4822732,10216457,"I'm working on a new iPhone project and I'm running into problems with sqlite.  I've done this before on a different project and it worked just fine so I'm not sure exactly what is going on with this one.  I'm using the same code from before, but the situation is a little different.
First of all, I'm trying this time to use Unit Testing so I've created a Cocoa Unit Test Bundle, and I got that working correctly, then I wanted to make a Unit Test for my sqlite database.
The first thing run with this test is [self checkAndCreateDatabase] which is as follows:
Then I attempt to open the database with the following line:
This fails everytime with error code 14 SQLITE_CANTOPEN, and databasePath is ""/Users/labuser/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/Documents/projectfusion.db3"".
What is odd is that when I go to that directory, Documents/ isn't there, so if I create that, then it doesn't fail, BUT projectfusion.db3 then has a size of 0kb; the tables aren't there.  That makes any sqlite3_prepare_v2() fail, because the tables aren't there.  If I manually copy the projectfusion.db3 file to that directory before running, then it works just fine.
Is it because I'm doing this inside the unit tests and the scripts don't have permission or something?  Or is it possibly because I'm working on a school computer at my university and can't write to that directory? (I tried logging in as admin and it didn't work either).

I pick someone to assign by hovering over a little drop down that will have a list of people I can select from. All my tasks will have the same set of users. The way it's been done right now, is the drop down is a template which has a helper to generate the list of users.
The problem is that the helper is being called on each list item. Add to that the face that I have a slightly complex function that alters the data upon retrieval. The complex function is also being called on each list item.
What I want to do is have a single reactive data point which will act as a single point of reference for the drop downs in all the list items. Thus the computations would happen only once upon page load, and all the drop downs would look to that data source. Is there a canonical way of doing this in Meteor?
My current idea is to store the computation in a var and when iterating through the list items, I check if the variable is null, and if it isn't I call the variable instead of the complex function. But there are the questions of where do I keep the var etc. Pretty sure there should be some common solution for this problem.

So, how I can change the IDE GUI font family? NOT code font family, NOT GUI font size, changing the the font FAMILY of GUI (menu, labels, etc.), please!!!
It's simply if you use Darcula Look and fill theme, but what if I use the Nimbus light theme?

1.

This module will allow you to set the font family and size of the fonts used by netbeans in the UI. When you add the command line switch -J-Dramos.nb.ui.font=""MyFavoriteFont,14"" to the netbeans options this module will set the font used by netbeans to the font named MyFavoriteFont with the size of 14. This doesn't seem to work with synth based look and feels.
Where I need to input in NetBeans options??!!

trying to get working example: http://jsfiddle.net/pseudorad10/GeRhW/1/
i'm attempting to port the functionality of the first example to the second.  jQuery builds the ""crumbs path"" by moving through the html structure relative to its origin, which is initially set by finding the navigation link's url and giving it a 'current' class.  Additional anchor elements that are 'in the path' are also given the 'current' class.
This identifies the breadcrumb elements and works well in the first example...
but fails on the second example as the html structure is somewhat different. I've modified it to no avail and cannot seem to find a way to reference the correct elements to build the path.

It does return Spanish_Spain.1252 but unfortunately, the loop iterations print the same data as the default C locale (using VC++ 8 / VS 2005).
Christophe shows different (desired) results as you can see in his screen shots below, but he uses a much newer version of VC++.

19526373,19526373,49943602,"I have an asp.net web application running on an IIS 7.5/.NET Framework 4.0 server.  Whenever I navigate to any webpage running on this server, it takes about 12 seconds to initially load.  After that, navigation is quick (about 0.5 seconds, even on heavy hitting pages).  If you leave it idle for two minutes, it slows again for the next request.  I can tell that this is because the connection time-out is set to 120 seconds...I am guessing that after that limit, the site must reload everything when the next page is requesting.  This site does call two different databases, however, default page should not do so and suffers the long initial load time.  I have tried setting up Application Initialization for IIS 7.5, but noticed very marginal change at best after this was done.  From what I've been reading, there seems to be very mixed success with this module in IIS 7.5.  Is there any other means of circumventing this load time without having to rely solely on a high connection timeout value, since that would not resolve initial load time anyway?
Update
Per Zerkey's question in the comments below, I got a little curious and looked around for ways to see what was loading, as debugging it from my PC was still slow, but considerably faster (about 4-6 seconds).  In IIS on the server this is published to, I went to Worker Processes, selected the process and clicked current requests on the right.  This showed me that it gets hung up on a 3rd party mobile redirection service I am using called 51degrees.mobi.  It takes about 10 of those 12 seconds for that redirect.  My timeout for this service was set too low.  As I recall, this timeout was set this way because the user has the ability to toggle back and forth between mobile and desktop after the initial redirect if they choose.  Disabling the timeout fixed the issue except on initial load/redirect, which would be fine, but now once the user tries to toggle between mobile/default, it will always take them to the desktop site until they clear their browser cache.  I am using 51degrees.mobi because more traditional methods like using isMobileDevice weren't even working.  If anyone has any input on how I could get the desired behavior out of 51degrees.mobi, I'm all ears.  I will post this in a new question and link when I can.

UPDATE: Just to test, I've created a new entry page, so index.html is not anymore the first page loaded. In this way the panel in index.html works correctly. It was just to completely exclude some unexpected behaviors related to the page. So the problem is exactly that it's the first page loaded.

30392313,30392313,91071415,"Okay, this seems to be getting the better of me.
I've been reading blog after blog, where guys explain how to get this going, but after countless hours of removing, adding, changing, debugging, pulling-at-hair, copious amounts of coffee and no luck in getting this to work, I'm turning here for some professional insight.
As the title suggest, I'm trying to get angular to work within an MVC 5 with Razor views, but I'm experiencing some very weird behavior.
Firstly, angular does not kick in on page load. I have to refresh the landing page at least 5 - 10 times before it kicks in.
When it eventually works, Chrome goes into overburn, consuming nearly all of the available resources before crashing. Console in developer tools comes up with a message ""Warning: Trying to load angular multiple times"".
The error is very descriptive, so I assume that I'm loading the _layout.cshtml page twice, when the client-side routing eventually kicks in, but each Razor view contains the @{ Layout = null } call, as it has been explained on so many blogs.
I've tried everything I could possibly read up on, and I cannot get passed this issue.
Following, my code:
ASP.Net Razor View
1.) _Layout.cshtml
I assumed that, because the is used for the index page (Home), it is where the angular instantiate should occur. I've seen blogs where they skip the all together, but to keep it consistent, I want this to be my starting point. I have tried to not use Layout in Home/Index, and call all my scripts in there, but it does the exact same thing, couple of refreshes, and Warning.
2.) Home/Index.cshtml
has been commented out, because this causes to not even load my JS files, weird behaviour :/
3.) Gallery/Index.cshtml
This is just a page to test the route.
4.) Web.config
The rewrite rule is important to ensure that the routing is done appropriately. I am using HTMLMode for angular, so this step is vital.
5.) app.js
There really is nothing weird about this, it creates the angular app reference, attaches the routing to the module and form there I configure the routing behavior.
From what I've read and understand, it makes sense to call the controller/action block as you would do normally in ASP.Net MVC.
The default routing for MVC I did not touch, as it's irrelevant in this scope.
I'm at a loss as to why this behavior is occurring and don't know where to start investigating. I've read blogs on the refresh issue and have tried what has been stated, but in this scenario, I just cannot get it to work.

19748769,19748769,50653981,"So i have this problem where i want input 5-digits and be sure that it's 5 digits.
If it's lower, it'd say, you don't have enough digits
If it's higher, it'd say, you have too many digits.
Also if you would input Char with the digits, it would say, that it's not valid.
This is what i got so far and where im stuck at.
I also want to know if their's a way to say
input > 5digits length.
Also, overall it keeps saying ""else without if"" case,default, or } expected on the first else if line.
tl;dr : My question would be, is there a way to input 5 digits and recognize them as digits, if it's higher or lower, and if their's any character in them, also how to loop it up so it'll repeat until 5 digits are entered under the corresponding criteria.
