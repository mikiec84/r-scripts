17356432,17346886,43024687,"Nice question!&#xD;&#xA;Several points should be made:  &#xD;&#xA; - First, as I guess you already know (though some readers of the question and this answer may not), your schema document 1 is already legal as it sits.  So you don't *need* to modify the schema for schema documents in order to make it legal.  If I understand you correctly, however, you want it not just to be valid; you want the variant of it in which element declarations occur without xs:documentation elements, or without ds:added and ds:last_modified attributes, to be *invalid*. &#xD;&#xA; - Second, it is possible to modify the XSD schema for XSD schema documents in the way you describe, and it is in principle possible to validate your schema documents against the modified schema for schema documents.  &#xD;&#xA;  But schema validators are allowed to have built-in knowledge of some schema components in arbitrary namespaces, and they are *required* to have built-in knowledge of the XSD namespace.  So it is possible for conforming schema validators to see a request to validate schema document 1, say ""Aha, I already know all I need to know about namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema, I don't need to read the schema document the user supplied"", and then not enforce the additional constraints you have specified.&#xD;&#xA;  Concretely, in my tests, I was able to use Xerces J to validate schema documents against a modified schema for schema documents, but Saxon seemed to ignore the modifications and rule the schema documents valid even when element declarations lacked the required attributes.&#xD;&#xA; - Similarly, it is not possible, when validating documents against the schemas you write, to require your XSD validators to object to schema documents that don't meet your heightened requirements.  &#xD;&#xA;With those background points out of the way, here is what you need to do.&#xD;&#xA;1. You do *not* need to import the ds schema into your schema document 1.  Importing it means that you can add references to the attributes ds:added, etc., to the types you declare in schema document 1 -- that is, it imports it into the schema being defined for the target namespace.  It has no effect on the schema used to validate schema documents (which is a schema for the namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema).&#xD;&#xA;2. You need to create a schema that modifies the standard schema for schema documents, and not just by adding new components but by redefining or overriding components in the existing schema for schema documents.  There are two ways to do this:  using xs:redefine, and (in XSD 1.1) using xs:override.  In XSD 1.1, xs:redefine is deprecated, because its specification has proven to be incomplete and/or inconsistent, and interoperability across processors is poor for some ways of using it.&#xD;&#xA;3. You need to use an XSD validator to validate your schema documents against your modified schema for schema documents.  As noted above, this may not work with all validators.  If you have trouble making your XSD validator handle the case, you may want to consider writing a Schematron schema to enforce the few constraints you mention, and building Schematron validation into your work flow.  (One of the advantages of Schematron is that validating just a few isolated aspects of a document is quite easy.  That may be a drawback in some situations, but not in this one or in other cases where one wants a little incremental increase in validation.  And if as your user name suggests you are an XSLT users, Schematron is likely to feel quite natural to you.)&#xD;&#xA;As a test, I've used xs:override to modify the schema for schema documents for XSD 1.1; the schema document is shown below, and the comments will, I hope, make reasonably clear what is going on.  If you have access only to an XSD 1.0 processor, you will need to use xs:redefine instead; some details will change.&#xD;&#xA;<hr/>&#xD;&#xA;*Addition* in response to comments.&#xD;&#xA;> 1(a). I still need to have a local copy of the schema used to validate schema documents, right? (in your case: sfsd-11.xsd, and in my case: the schema found at w3.org/2001/XMLSchema ? [named however I choose to name it?)?&#xD;&#xA;To use either override (in XSD 1.1) or redefine (in 1.0 or 1.1), you will need to point to a schemaLocation for the schema you are modifying.  If you have a local copy of the schema for schema documents, you can certainly point to it, but it's equally possible to point to the copy on the W3C server.  So:  no, you don't ""need"" to have a local copy.  You may well want to, though:  W3C's servers take a beating from software that tries to dereference DTDs and schema documents every time it parses an XML document, and W3C's system administrators have responded by making their servers respond very slowly to such requests.  A local copy if thus likely to be more convenient, even though it's in no sense required.&#xD;&#xA;> 1(b). When I try and save the local copy of the schema found at w3.org/2001/XMLSchema, I get validation errors for that schema, citing that 'xs:occurs' is already declared.' If I comment out that attributeGroup, I get similar errors throughout. &#xD;&#xA;When you try to *save* it?  That sounds as if your file system were performing schema validation on files you save; that would be novel behavior.  I suspect that the validation errors you are seeing are arising in some other context; without knowing what the validator is trying to do and how it was invoked, it's hard to tell just what's going on here.  The message about attribute group xs:occurs already being declared suggests that your validator is seeing the schema for schema documents twice; either because it's got knowledge of the namespace built in (in which case you may not be able to make your validator use a modified schema for the namespace at all) or because of an error in the way you have put your schema together, or because of an error in the way the validator was invoked.&#xD;&#xA;> 1 (c). Note that I have included the XMLSchema.dtd header at the top of my localy saved schema (and have the dtd locally saved) the attributes of my local schema: &#xD;&#xA;No obvious problem here.

17356432,17346886,43028589,"Nice question!&#xD;&#xA;Several points should be made:  &#xD;&#xA; - First, as I guess you already know (though some readers of the question and this answer may not), your schema document 1 is already legal as it sits.  So you don't *need* to modify the schema for schema documents in order to make it legal.  If I understand you correctly, however, you want it not just to be valid; you want the variant of it in which element declarations occur without xs:documentation elements, or without ds:added and ds:last_modified attributes, to be *invalid*. &#xD;&#xA; - Second, it is possible to modify the XSD schema for XSD schema documents in the way you describe, and it is in principle possible to validate your schema documents against the modified schema for schema documents.  &#xD;&#xA;  But schema validators are allowed to have built-in knowledge of some schema components in arbitrary namespaces, and they are *required* to have built-in knowledge of the XSD namespace.  So it is possible for conforming schema validators to see a request to validate schema document 1, say ""Aha, I already know all I need to know about namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema, I don't need to read the schema document the user supplied"", and then not enforce the additional constraints you have specified.&#xD;&#xA;  Concretely, in my tests, I was able to use Xerces J to validate schema documents against a modified schema for schema documents, but Saxon seemed to ignore the modifications and rule the schema documents valid even when element declarations lacked the required attributes.&#xD;&#xA; - Similarly, it is not possible, when validating documents against the schemas you write, to require your XSD validators to object to schema documents that don't meet your heightened requirements.  &#xD;&#xA;With those background points out of the way, here is what you need to do.&#xD;&#xA;1. You do *not* need to import the ds schema into your schema document 1.  Importing it means that you can add references to the attributes ds:added, etc., to the types you declare in schema document 1 -- that is, it imports it into the schema being defined for the target namespace.  It has no effect on the schema used to validate schema documents (which is a schema for the namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema).&#xD;&#xA;2. You need to create a schema that modifies the standard schema for schema documents, and not just by adding new components but by redefining or overriding components in the existing schema for schema documents.  There are two ways to do this:  using xs:redefine, and (in XSD 1.1) using xs:override.  In XSD 1.1, xs:redefine is deprecated, because its specification has proven to be incomplete and/or inconsistent, and interoperability across processors is poor for some ways of using it.&#xD;&#xA;3. You need to use an XSD validator to validate your schema documents against your modified schema for schema documents.  As noted above, this may not work with all validators.  If you have trouble making your XSD validator handle the case, you may want to consider writing a Schematron schema to enforce the few constraints you mention, and building Schematron validation into your work flow.  (One of the advantages of Schematron is that validating just a few isolated aspects of a document is quite easy.  That may be a drawback in some situations, but not in this one or in other cases where one wants a little incremental increase in validation.  And if as your user name suggests you are an XSLT users, Schematron is likely to feel quite natural to you.)&#xD;&#xA;As a test, I've used xs:override to modify the schema for schema documents for XSD 1.1; the schema document is shown below, and the comments will, I hope, make reasonably clear what is going on.  If you have access only to an XSD 1.0 processor, you will need to use xs:redefine instead; some details will change.&#xD;&#xA;<hr/>&#xD;&#xA;*Addition* in response to comments.&#xD;&#xA;> 1(a). I still need to have a local copy of the schema used to validate schema documents, right? (in your case: sfsd-11.xsd, and in my case: the schema found at w3.org/2001/XMLSchema ? [named however I choose to name it?)?&#xD;&#xA;To use either override (in XSD 1.1) or redefine (in 1.0 or 1.1), you will need to point to a schemaLocation for the schema you are modifying.  If you have a local copy of the schema for schema documents, you can certainly point to it, but it's equally possible to point to the copy on the W3C server.  So:  no, you don't ""need"" to have a local copy.  You may well want to, though:  W3C's servers take a beating from software that tries to dereference DTDs and schema documents every time it parses an XML document, and W3C's system administrators have responded by making their servers respond very slowly to such requests.  A local copy if thus likely to be more convenient, even though it's in no sense required.&#xD;&#xA;> 1(b). When I try and save the local copy of the schema found at w3.org/2001/XMLSchema, I get validation errors for that schema, citing that 'xs:occurs' is already declared.' If I comment out that attributeGroup, I get similar errors throughout. &#xD;&#xA;When you try to *save* it?  That sounds as if your file system were performing schema validation on files you save; that would be novel behavior.  I suspect that the validation errors you are seeing are arising in some other context; without knowing what the validator is trying to do and how it was invoked, it's hard to tell just what's going on here.  The message about attribute group xs:occurs already being declared suggests that your validator is seeing the schema for schema documents twice; either because it's got knowledge of the namespace built in (in which case you may not be able to make your validator use a modified schema for the namespace at all) or because of an error in the way you have put your schema together, or because of an error in the way the validator was invoked.&#xD;&#xA;> 1 (c). Note that I have included the XMLSchema.dtd header at the top of my localy saved schema (and have the dtd locally saved) the attributes of my local schema: &#xD;&#xA;No obvious problem here.  The document type declaration is not strictly speaking required, but if you are not encountering 'could not find DTD' errors, it is probably doing no harm.&#xD;&#xA;> 1 (c) (continued) When I delete xmlns:xs=""w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""; (which I suspected would get rid of the duplicate definition errors, I get another error that states ""Element 'xs:schema' has no declaration for an attribute named 'xmlns:hfp'"" Can you or anyone tell me what the I'm doing wrong here? &#xD;&#xA;You have a document which uses the namespace prefix `xs` on virtually every element.  You do *not* want to delete the namespace binding for that prefix.&#xD;&#xA;Making an XSD validator use a modified form of the schema for schema documents is, in its way, an advanced topic in the use of XSD.  (Any time you use language L to describe and potentially to modify language L, it's easy to work yourself into confusions between the object language and the metalanguage.  Ask your nearest guru how long it took them to understand the first meta-circular interpreter they ever studied.)&#xD;&#xA;If you are at the stage of your work with XML and XSD that you have any doubts as to the likely effect of deleting a namespace declaration in one of your schema documents, you may find the task you have undertaken a very challenging exercise.  I won't say you shouldn't spend time on it, for much the same reason I wouldn't tell a teenager not to spend time rebuilding an engine.  It may be fun, and you may learn a lot.  But if you're not doing this as an end in itself, you need to know that it's not going to be quick or simple.  You are unlikely to get it to work by fiddling with namespace declarations in this way.  (In this context, I recommend you read [the story of Tom Knight and the Lisp Machine](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/koans.html).)"

For this approach I searched for an alternative way then using `Activator.CreateInstance` because the number of instances may increase heavily during development.

These controllers can have their own subcontrollers, and so on. All standard stuff really.&#xD;&#xA;So why is the **parentViewController** property readonly? It's used by *UINavigationController* and *UITabBarController*, and many other properties rely on it (for example the **navigationController** property).&#xD;&#xA;I've seen many people telling us to create our own property for managing view controller hierarchies, but that's a little silly when Apple's own framework uses its own private ""*you can't touch it*"" hierarchy model."

(This is trait defines the actual navigation hierarchy i.e. you can back out of subviews.) If the property is readwrite it might not be set,might not be set correctly or might suddenly change all of which would orphan the controller.

14378339,14378339,34595578,"To simplify the question, I will describe a simplified use case:&#xD;&#xA;Let's say I have a top level Grid that contains 1 dynamic inner Grid and a ListBox that fits in certain cells of the top level Grid:&#xD;&#xA;1. The top level Grid structure (TopGrid.xaml) is relatively static with only dynamic size of the cell that will contain the inner Grid.&#xD;&#xA;2. The inner Grid structure is dynamic, there are many/unkown kind of contents, but each kind of content is static and can be represented by a separate XAML. So I will have InnerGrid_1.xaml, InnerGrid_2.xaml, InnerGrid_n.xaml, etc.&#xD;&#xA;3. At run time, depend on the ListBox selection, certain InnerGrid should be displayed.&#xD;&#xA;I'm thinking of two ways to do it:&#xD;&#xA;1. Run time text-edit the XAML in the code:&#xD;&#xA;In the code, use XmlDocument to edit the TopGrid.xaml to add the content of certain InnerGrid_x.xaml to create the final in-memory TopGrid.xaml. Then use XamlReader to read the final TopGrid.xaml into a Visual Tree, then add the tree to LayoutRoot to show it.&#xD;&#xA;2. Visual Tree manipulation (no text edit):&#xD;&#xA;In the code, use XamlReader to read the TopGrid.xaml into a top-visual-tree, read InnerGrid_x.xaml into a sub-visual-tree. Then use VisualTreeHelper to find the TopGrid element in top-visual-tree, find the InnerGrid element in the sub-visual-tree. Then add the sub-visual-tree to the top-visual tree. Then add the combined tree to LayoutRoot show it.&#xD;&#xA;I know the first way will work but need complex XML manipulation (or text editing) in the code. I desire the second way but not sure if it will work. Especially, I will probably change the size of the cell in the TopGrid to hold the dynamic InnerGrid. &#xD;&#xA;Anybody has done this and can shed some light? or any better solution?&#xD;&#xA;A side question: Seems the dynamically loaded XAML cannot specify event handler inside XAML (my test), I need set event handler dynamically after creating the tree. Is that true?"

Since you are passing `obj->length` to `mbstowcs` as the maximum number of `wchar_t` values to write to the destination, it will run out of space and not be able to write the null terminator unless there's a proper multibyte character (one which requires more than a single byte) in the source string.

957052,957038,1855636,"I don't personally put the breaks in, but it could help when someone else decides to move the return (-1) to outside of the switch and forgets to add break."
957055,957038,1855642,"You don't need either break, but there's no harm in having them. In my opinion, keeping your code structured is worth having a couple of extraneous statements. "
957071,957038,1855667,"Neither break does anything for you, but neither does harm.&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I usually leave them out if I have a return - but I also try to avoid having multiple return points in a function if possible.&#xD;&#xA;However, I do think the break in the `default:` case is good - for one reason:  If you were to leave it out, and somebody added a new case after default:, the behavior would be different if they ""forget"" to add in a break."
958668,957038,1858684,"Regarding the comment that others have made that they leave the break in the default case in case someone comes by later and adds a case after it: Where I work, the coding standard says to *always* put the default as the last case; so in our situation, a break on that case is just redundant. (This is one case where I agree wholeheartedly with the company's coding standard, because with the default case always being the last one, you always know where to find it, even in a long switch-statement.)&#xD;&#xA;As for breaks after returns, I tend to omit the break unless there are any execution paths that do not return, as I find it redundant. (My exception to this is, on the rare occasions when there are several execution paths in a case and I can't tell with a quick scan of the code whether or not they all return, then I'll leave the break in just to be safe.)"
957080,957038,1855678,I would put the break in to show that you do not intend to fall through to next case.
957038,957038,1855610,"My OCD makes me add ""break"" when writing case statements, even if they will not be executed.  Consider the following code example:&#xD;&#xA;My two questions are:  &#xD;&#xA;For ""case 2:"", I don't really need the break, but is it a good idea to have it there anyway?&#xD;&#xA;For ""default:"".  Is it purely OCD, or is there any real reason to have the break here?"
958451,957038,1858285,"I'm told that in C, C++, java and C#, if you don't put those ""breaks"" the program code flow will fall into the other ""cases"" and will execute the instructions inside them, not matter if the variable doesn't have the values assignned to the ""cases""."
957079,957038,1855677,"I agree with having a break in a final default case, and don't agree with breaks after returns.  (A colleague does those and it hurts my eyes.)&#xD;&#xA;I also indent switches so as to reduce proliferation of indent levels. :)  i.e.:&#xD;&#xA;(I also think that, since the return statement is not a function, it isn't appropriate to enforce a superfluous style that makes it look like one.)"
957083,957038,1855682,"I would consider the break after return to be bad form, you will get warnings about unreachable code on some compilers.&#xD;&#xA;The break on your default case is completely appropriate, case fall through is a tool and should be especially marked when used."

957359,957038,1856218,"As others have pointed out, placing a break after a return or in the default case is mostly a matter of personal style.&#xD;&#xA;When I don't have to follow any specific style rules, I prefer something like this:&#xD;&#xA;Between cases 1 and 2, I tend to prefer 2.  Even though the comment says NOTREACHED, comments can lie ( unintentionally of course ) when the code changes.  I like the NOTREACHED comment since it can satisfy lint that you know what you are doing and serves as a reminder that you exiting the function early.  The reasoning that placing a break after the return will mitigate errors if the return is deleted seem flawed to me.  You are still going to get bogus behavior regardless if you fall through to the next case or you exit the switch and continue on as before. &#xD;&#xA;Of course, if I can avoid it I would not return from a function within the body of a switch. &#xD;&#xA;               "
957433,957038,1856372,"I prefer always have a break in each *case* including the *default* and avoid doing return at all inside *switch*'s. For short switches with just 2-3 cases(including default) *return* is ok but only if all *case*s do it the same way. 'pointless' break i see as pointless and only make's it more code to read. Same goes for empty defaults that just do break, totally pointless. The ease to read the code is in my opinion more important that what happens if someone happens to change this or that."
958267,957038,1857937,"In this exact example, for both questions, it is personal preference. In general, the rule is this: anything without a break will fall through. That means (as Pod said) its a good idea to put breaks in default cases in case they are not last. This also means if your case contains a return, then a following break is indeed not necessary. "

You first locally ""erase"" the definitions of `Part` using `Block`, so the expression you're interested in can be safely constructed, and then uses `With` to interpolate that into a `Function` which can then be safely returned outside of the `Block`, and also uses the fact that `Slot` doesn't really mean anything outside of `Function`. &#xD;&#xA;Using your example:&#xD;&#xA;I don't know if this is all that much less cumbersome than using `Hold`, but it is different."

The only part that is different is how you invoke the two functions.&#xD;&#xA;Technically, SHA1 is defined on bytes rather than strings, but (correct me if I'm wrong) PHP strings work with single-byte characters, so bytes and characters should be interchangable from the SHA1 algorithm's point of you.&#xD;&#xA;You'll have to make sure that your string's value in binary is the same as .NET's byte array, in the same order. I'm not a PHP guy, so you'll have to get someone else's answer for how to do that."
616123,616087,1048104,"It looks like the sha1 function takes a byte array which is in hexidecimal notation.  So if you had two bytes, FA and A1, your string would be ""FAA1"".&#xD;&#xA;Then, you would parse the result string back into bytes and compare with the .NET output.&#xD;&#xA;Note that you could create this string in .NET with the same format rather easily (use the ""x2"" format on the call to ToString on each byte and append all together)."
616087,616087,1048128,"I have a set of bytes I want to apply an sha1 hash to. One hash will be in .net, the other in PHP. Then I'll test to see if they match.&#xD;&#xA;In .net, you can create a byte array and use sha.ComputeHash().&#xD;&#xA;In PHP, you call sha1($string). &#xD;&#xA;I can't do anything about the .net side of the code, but how can I get the same hash out of PHP that .net will generate?

A leak what happens when a program deletes a reference to something but does not release the memory it consumes. &#xD;&#xA;The last time I remember that JS developers had to really worry about genuine leaks was when Internet Explorer (6 and 7 I think) used separate memory management for the DOM and for JS. Because of this, it was possible to bind an `onclick` event to a button, destroy the button, and still have the event handler stranded in memory -- forever (or until the browser crashed or was closed by the user). You couldn't trigger the handler or release it after the fact. It just sat on the stack, taking up room. So if you had a long-lived webapp or a webpage that created and destroyed a lot of DOM elements, you had to be super diligent to always unbind events before destroying them.&#xD;&#xA;I've also run into a few annoying leaks in iOS but these were all bugs and were (eventually) patched by Apple.&#xD;&#xA;That said, a good developer needs to keep resource management in mind when writing code. Consider these two constructors:&#xD;&#xA;If you were to create a thousand instances of `F`, the browser would have to allocate an extra gigabyte of memory for all those copies of the huge string. And every time you deleted an instance, you might get some onscreen jankiness when the GC eventually recovered that ram. On the other hand, if you made a thousand instances of `G`, the huge string would be created once and reused by every instance. That is a huge performance boost.&#xD;&#xA;But the advantage of `F` is that the huge string is essentially private. No other code outside of the constructor would be able to access that string directly. Because of that, each instance of `F` could mutate that string as much as it wanted and you'd never have to worry about causing problems for other instances.&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, the huge string in `G` is out there for anyone to change.

27757576,27757220,80890241,"Here's my approach:&#xD;&#xA;Update: removed conversion to numeric (not required)&#xD;&#xA;Brief explanation:&#xD;&#xA; - `as.POSIXct(sdf$ts)` converts the dates to POSIXct-style date-times&#xD;&#xA; - `rollmean(as.POSIXct(sdf$ts), 2)` computes the rolling mean of each two consecutive rows. This happens to be exactly the time you want to use for separating the observations. `rollmean` is from package `zoo`. Computing a `rollmean(..,2)` means the output vector is shortened by 1 compared to the input vector.&#xD;&#xA; - That is why I wrap the result of `rollmean` in `c(.., Inf)` which means that the infinity value is added to the rollmean vector as the last value. This will ensure that the last entries of `z` in `sdf` are also returned (0.3 in the specific example).&#xD;&#xA; - I use `transform` to add the `z` column to `bdf`&#xD;&#xA; - `sapply(tb, function(x) which.max(x < m))` loops through the entries in `bdf$tb` and for each entry, computes the maximum index for which `bdf$tb` is less (earlier) than `m` (which holds the vector of rollmean entries). Only the maximum (latest) index is returned for each `bdf$tb` entry.&#xD;&#xA; - That vector of indices is used in `sdf$y[sapply(tb, function(x) which.max(x < m))]` to extract the corresponding elements of `sdf$y` which will then be stored/copied to the new `z` column in `bdf`&#xD;&#xA;Hope that helps"

Observers are my preferred way to go, for a couple reasons.&#xD;&#xA;First, if you use TDD (test-driven development) you can shut off observers to more purely test the model without every creation firing off a mailer creation.  Then you can unit test the mailer and observer separately.&#xD;&#xA;Second, the idea of separating callbacks creates cleaner code.  Callbacks aren't really part of your model, they are events.  Your model contains the functions and attributes necessary to run itself, and the callbacks (implemented with observers) are separate event handlers.&#xD;&#xA;That said, I don't think your second option is ""bad"" or less professional.  Either way works as long as it's at the model level, instead of controllers or (even worse) views."

Guice ultimately uses either reflection to set the value of myField, or it may use an auto-generated setter. There is no happens-before relation so that reflection-write happens-before field-read or method-invocation happens-before field-read (unless locks, volatiles or other means are used which forms the happens-before relation).&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, I would say that there is a (perhaps rather low) possibility of seeing null values.&#xD;&#xA;EDIT: as per http://bit.ly/1m4AUIz writing to final field after the constructor ends (via reflection) holds the same semantics as initializing the field in the constructor. So, make Guice-injected fields final, set them to null and it should work correctly. This is indeed a very dark JVM corner :-)&#xD;&#xA;Moreover, as per http://bit.ly/1m4AwJU Guice performs injections in exactly one thread which makes it thread-safe...

The precautions you take with respect to thread safety would be the same as if you called `new MyClass()` yourself. If you access that instance from multiple threads, you'll need to make sure that `MyClass` is thread-safe or provide some synchronization around it.&#xD;&#xA;If `MyClass` is in a wider scope such as `@SessionScoped` or `@ApplicaionScoped`, then the same instance (or a proxy to it) could be injected into multiple injection points in the same context. For example, If you have parallel browser requests from the same session accessing `MyClass` and `MyClass` is annotated `@SessionScoped`, you could have multiple threads accessing the same instance in parallel. CDI isn't going to put any synchronization around this for you, so you'd have to make sure that `MyClass` is thread safe."

Well now, you've just described Adobe's Source Pro, and Google's Noto (which are the same font).&#xD;&#xA;As for the ""how hard can it be"": a uniform style for all glyphs in Unicode, across 129 established written scripts on this planet, each with their own typesetting rules? Incredibly hard. You may think fonts are just files with pictures for letters, and someone types a letter, that picture shows up: that is not how fonts work, and isn't how fonts have worked since the late 1980's.&#xD;&#xA;Modern fonts are the typographic equivalent of a game ROM: sure, it's not much use without the hardware or software to run that ROM on, but all the things that actually matter are in the ROM. Similary, modern fonts contain *all* the information for typesetting. Not just pictures, they contain the metadata, the metrics, the positioning and substitutions rules for arbitrary sequences, with separate rulesets for each written script that OpenType supports, possible bitmap fallbacks for small-point rendering, hinting instructions on how to properly rasterize vector graphics that are inherently not aligned to any particular pixel grid, and more. A modern font is a ridiculously complex application that a font engine consults to figure out how to typeset sequences of code points, and making a (set of) Unicode-encompassing font(s) is a vast team effort.&#xD;&#xA;So: ""Why isn't there a font that contains all Unicode glyphs?"", because that's been technically impossible since 2001. We can, and do, make **font families** that cover all of Unicode, but with 129 different scripts all with their own typesetting rules, it's a large team effort.&#xD;&#xA;And as for this:&#xD;&#xA;> Such a font would be a great help to humanity and I can't see a good technical reason why it doesn't exist or at least an open-source effort to create it, so I presume an invisible-to-me reason why it can't be done.&#xD;&#xA;Just because you didn't know about them, doesn't mean they don't exist, with millions of people who *are* familiar with them. They exist, [they're even open source](https://github.com/adobe-fonts), go out and thank the people who made them =)"
