From

The expression T(), where T is a simple-type-speci<U+FB01>er or
typename-speci<U+FB01>er for a non-array complete object type or the
(possibly cv-quali<U+FB01>ed) void type, creates a prvalue of the speci<U+FB01>ed
type,which is valueinitialized (8.5; no initialization is done for the
void() case). [Note: if T is a non-class type that is cv-quali<U+FB01>ed, the
cv-quali<U+FB01>ers are ignored when determining the type of the resulting
prvalue (3.10). —end note]
What that means is that effectively treated as .
