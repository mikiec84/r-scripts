I have a circle shape dynamic body that simulates a bouncing ball, I set the restitution to 2 and it just gets out of control to the point it does't stop from bouncing up and down. So I want to slow down the ball linear or angular velocity using Damping.
When the linear velocity of the ball reaches 80 or above I set its linear Damping to 50 then it  just goes super slow motion. Can someone please explain me how Damping works and how to use method properly, thanks.
EDIT
This is what I did, if the linear velocity exceeded from what I need it sets the ball linear Damping to 20 if not always set it to 0.5f. This creates and effect that the gravity changes constantly and instantly. However @minos23 answer is correct because it simulates the ball more naturally you just need to set the MAX_VELOCITY that you need.
