I am writing a program to control iTunes using the iTunes COM Interface and VB.NET. I am trying to figure out how to update labels in my program with the new track information when the track changes in iTunes. I haven't been able to figure this out. When the track changes, how do I update my labels with that new information? My program doesn't seem to know that the track changed. I try to update the information, but the program doesn't seem to get the new track information from iTunes. What do I need to do? I am using this method to update the labels:
I think the labels are technically being updated, but as I said before, I don't think the program is getting the new track information, so it doesn't appear that they changed. If I restart my program, it gets the new information and updates the label accordingly.
