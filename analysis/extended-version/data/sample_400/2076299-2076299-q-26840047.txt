I want to create a link on a webpage that would close current active tab in a browser without closing other tabs in the browser. When user clicks close link, an alert message should appear asking user to confirm with two buttons, "YES" and "NO". If user clicks "YES", close that page and If "NO", do nothing.
How can it be done? Any suggestions?
