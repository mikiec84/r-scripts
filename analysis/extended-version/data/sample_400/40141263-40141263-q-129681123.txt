I need to make 2 database constraints that connect two different tables at one time.

1.  The total score of the two quarters equals the total score of the game the quarters belong to.

2.  The total point of all the players equals to the score of the game of that team.

Here is what my tables look like.
So Virtually I need to use CHECK I think to make sure that players points = score of their team ie (hScore, aScore) and also make sure that the hScore and aScore = the total score in the Game table.
Thanks
