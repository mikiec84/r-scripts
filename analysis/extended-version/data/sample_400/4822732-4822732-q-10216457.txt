I'm working on a new iPhone project and I'm running into problems with sqlite.  I've done this before on a different project and it worked just fine so I'm not sure exactly what is going on with this one.  I'm using the same code from before, but the situation is a little different.
First of all, I'm trying this time to use Unit Testing so I've created a Cocoa Unit Test Bundle, and I got that working correctly, then I wanted to make a Unit Test for my sqlite database.
The first thing run with this test is [self checkAndCreateDatabase] which is as follows:
Then I attempt to open the database with the following line:
This fails everytime with error code 14 SQLITE_CANTOPEN, and databasePath is "/Users/labuser/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/Documents/projectfusion.db3".
What is odd is that when I go to that directory, Documents/ isn't there, so if I create that, then it doesn't fail, BUT projectfusion.db3 then has a size of 0kb; the tables aren't there.  That makes any sqlite3_prepare_v2() fail, because the tables aren't there.  If I manually copy the projectfusion.db3 file to that directory before running, then it works just fine.
Is it because I'm doing this inside the unit tests and the scripts don't have permission or something?  Or is it possibly because I'm working on a school computer at my university and can't write to that directory? (I tried logging in as admin and it didn't work either).
