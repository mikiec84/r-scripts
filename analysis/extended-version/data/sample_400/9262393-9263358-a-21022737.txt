I'm jumping in feet first here as there are a lot of unknowns about you particular code base, but I'm wondering is there is any mileage in a session based approach? You could have a (thread safe) session factory singleton that is responsible for ensuring only one environment is initialised and that environment is disposed appropriately by binding it to events on the ASP.NET AppDomain and/or similar.  You would need to bake this session model into your API so that all client first established a session before making any calls.  Apologies for the vagueness of this answer.  If you can provide some example code perhaps I could give a more specific/detail answer.
