I have a circle shape dynamic body that simulates a bouncing ball, I set the restitution to 2 and it just gets out of control to the point it does't stop from bouncing up and down. So I want to slow down the ball linear or angular velocity using Damping.
When the linear velocity of the ball reaches 80 or above I set its linear Damping to 50 then it  just goes super slow motion. Can someone please explain me how Damping works and how to use method properly, thanks.
