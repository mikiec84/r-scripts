My OCD makes me add "break" when writing case statements, even if they will not be executed.  Consider the following code example:
My two questions are:
For "case 2:", I don't really need the break, but is it a good idea to have it there anyway?
For "default:".  Is it purely OCD, or is there any real reason to have the break here?
