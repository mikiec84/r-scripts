does not work with forked test runs as mentioned in another Stackoverflow answer.
But there are workarounds:
Set fork to false
This is simple but may slow down your tests because they won't be executed in parallel.
Use the test framework
For example with the protected method afterAll()
Override the test task
My favorite.
