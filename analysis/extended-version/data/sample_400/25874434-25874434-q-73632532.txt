I am using Google Docs and unfortunately it does not have a function.  As I add more categories and subcategories to my data, the Pivot Table data will be moving (column wise).
So I took the liberty to use formulas and find the Row and Column numbers for all my ranges, so regardless of any new data, my range will expand/contract/shift with the correct data.
Now all I have left is to use a to feed the data for that specific subcategory.  I have a cell that shows the value for my range.... my range is ... but like I said, if I add one more subcategory, then my range will be D7:T100 and my cell will reflect this change.  I want to use this cell reference in my so it can be dynamic in the range.
Can the range ever be a cell reference so my vlookup's range be dynamic?
