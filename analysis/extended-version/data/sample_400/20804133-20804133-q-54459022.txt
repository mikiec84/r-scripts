I'm creating the "framework" to control a Hexapod.
So (simplifying) I have a Servo class:
class Servo(object):
...
...
and a child HexBone class:
class HexBone(Servo):
## Servo.init override:
def init(self, I2C_ADDRESS, channel, length, startAngle, reversed=False, minAngle=NULL, maxAngle):
self = Servo(I2C_ADDRESS, channel, reversed, minAngle, maxAngle)

and also a HexLimb class:
class HexLimb(object):
def init(self, I2C_ADDRESS, femurLength, tibiaLength, femurInv, tibiaInv):
#Setting precision of Limb Positioning
self.precision=1

In the HexLimb class whenever I do:
self.femur.setAngle(30) I want to call self.calcPosition() to recalculate the limb's tip position.
I've been searching all over and couldn't found any answer...Am I doing it the wrong way?
