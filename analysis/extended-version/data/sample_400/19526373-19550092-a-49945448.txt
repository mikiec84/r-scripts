Was not related the connection timeout as I thought it was, but rather another timeout and necessary files missing.  Per Zerkey's question in the comments above, I got a little curious and looked around for ways to see what was loading, as debugging it from my PC was still slow, but considerably faster (about 4-6 seconds).  In IIS on the server this is published to, I went to Worker Processes, selected the process and clicked current requests on the right.  This showed me that it gets hung up on a 3rd party mobile redirection service I am using called 51degrees.mobi.  It was taking about 10 of those 12 seconds for those file to load.  What was happening is that the logging capabilities were set to log in an App_Data folder, and that directory was missing.  It evidently wasn't giving me a visible error, it was just trying it and failing.  Once I added this directory and log file, and reactivated Application Initialization, everything is quick.
