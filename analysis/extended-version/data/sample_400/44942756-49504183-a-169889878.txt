Based on the discussion on question and experience I now have:

  - API user needs to be an admin of the ad account and of the app if you
    wish to use the API.
  - The ad account needs to be specifically added to the app, in app settings. In developer access an app can only have access to a maximum of 5 ad accounts.
  - Error messages in Facebook API are misleading more often than not. Fix anything marked in yellow or red anywhere in the portal, to be
    sure.
  - Do read about limits of every API before you use it, all API have different limits and your application design needs to take those into account.
    As for the question, yes the issue was the text in red, as pointed out by @CBroe, although the error message was off by a mile and issue occurred only when using our own app.
