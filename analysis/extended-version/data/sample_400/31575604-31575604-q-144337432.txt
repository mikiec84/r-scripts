I have developed an Android application that stores camera captured images to a MySQL database. I am trying to store images into a Blob field in MySQL database but I am not able to store the image in the database and also not able to retrieve the image from the database in my list view that has the ImageView. How can i do this
Since I did not have enough resource to save the images to a file. That why I have adopted this method.
I have used the below class to insert the image in the database.

I have used the below PHP script to insert the image in the database.
I am also using a class to convert the image to base64

In order to retrieve the values from the database I have used the below php code
