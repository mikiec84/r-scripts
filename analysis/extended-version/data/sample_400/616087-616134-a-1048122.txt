Since SHA1 is a common, standard algorithm, it is implemented the same way in PHP as it is in .NET. The only part that is different is how you invoke the two functions.
Technically, SHA1 is defined on bytes rather than strings, but (correct me if I'm wrong) PHP strings work with single-byte characters, so bytes and characters should be interchangable from the SHA1 algorithm's point of you.
You'll have to make sure that your string's value in binary is the same as .NET's byte array, in the same order. I'm not a PHP guy, so you'll have to get someone else's answer for how to do that.
