Totally agree with Ben. Try asking the opposite question. Why did Apple create a tabBarController and navigationController property in a UIViewController. This could've easily, well not easily, be accomplished with some hacking around of the parentViewController property. Something like this to find the tab view controller would be common across all apps:
Yes, it probably goes against intuition as a navigation, or a tab bar controller, is most likely also a parent view controller.
There is no harm in using the parentViewController property actually. To get past the warning, checkout this thread -
But once you expose any data/behavior in the hierarchy's parent view controller, these isKindOfClass checks would become far too common.
