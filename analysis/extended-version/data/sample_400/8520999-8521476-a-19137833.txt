Yeah, I have ['in'] on the page, I mistyped it here.
that's the problem.
the only your problem.
it is obvious that nothing mysterious in a variable name, expecially when this variable gets interpolated and do not interfere with SQL at all.
thus, the only possible reason left - the typo again.
And as you fail to post the correct code here, it is become impossible to even find that typo for you.  You have to do it yourself.
The only thing you can do to help yourself is to print out each interpolated variables and compare them.
Instead of silly one-liner a sane programmer would separate his code into several lines for the better readability/maintainability:
thus you can comment out the actual query execution and print the query out instead, for the debugging purposes.
And thus you'll be able to see yourself, if there is any difference in a variable names.
