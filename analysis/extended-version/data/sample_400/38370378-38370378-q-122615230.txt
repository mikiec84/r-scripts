I have several containing integers such as:
0,0,0,0,0,30,30,30,40,40,50,50,50,40,0,0,0,30,30,30.
I want to print (, and later ) them like this: 30,40,50,40,30. Basically ignore the duplicates if they come after each other.
Another example:
0,0,0,010,10,10,10,50,50,50,50,10,10,10,50,50 shall give: 10,50,10,50
Help is very much appreciated!
