@pstar: One thing more. Because you don't use voting I want point your attension to the following simple rule: here you could read "As you see new answers to your question, vote up the helpful ones by clicking the upward pointing arrow to the left of the answer. Answers are normally sorted by vote score so the most highly voted answers float to the top. Other users will also vote on the answers to your question." To be not misunderstood I recommend you to follow the rule and use voting.
