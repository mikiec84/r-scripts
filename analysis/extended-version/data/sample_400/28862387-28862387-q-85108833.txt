I have 3 ListViews in a UserForm and also a few other items. Currently when I expand the UserForm, the ListViews and other items expand in relation to the increase in size of the UserForm.
What I'm after doing is also expanding the size of the Columns within the ListViews by cycling through all Controls on the UserForm and checking if it is a ListView, then cycling through all the columns and extending as required.
This is where I am currently at...
Anyone any ideas?
