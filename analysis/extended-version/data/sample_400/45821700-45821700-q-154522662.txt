After creating a typical ASP.NET Core project, is it possible to name the Program class something else. I ask because "Program" is a word in my domain and having this class in the root namespace is a headache. Any other suggestions to work around this problem are welcome.
The issue is that if you are in MyNamespace.Controller for example you automatically get the classes in MyNamespace, like Program. So the code will compile but I will have picked up the wrong class. The trouble I ran into is with EntityFramework configuration. I end up picking up the MyNamespace.Program class instead of MyNamespace.Domain.Program class on accident. The code compiles but then fails at run time. The cleanest way I figured to avoid this was to rename MyNamespace.Program to MyNamespace.ProgramLauncher.
