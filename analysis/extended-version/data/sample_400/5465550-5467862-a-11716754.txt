As R. M. correctly points out, what you are seeing used in that code is an anonymous function. Creating one is done in the following way:
Where is a list of input arguments that are used in the computation of the function expression .
What you may be confused about is why the code requires that an anonymous function be created instead of just using a function handle for an existing function. The MATLAB solver routines like and  will only pass two inputs to the function handle passed to them: a scalar and a column vector . If you have a situation where you want more parameters to be passed to the function to define its behavior, you have to supply the function with those parameters in other ways as described in the documentation for parameterizing functions.
Anonymous functions are one way to do this. In your example, you can see that the function takes a third argument that supply the function with extra parameters. When the anonymous function is made, this third input is frozen at the value(s) it contained at that moment. The anonymous function therefore acts as a wrapper that makes a three-input function behave like a two-input function so that it can be used by the solver routines, supplying the wrapped function with the extra inputs it needs that the solver routines can't pass to it.
