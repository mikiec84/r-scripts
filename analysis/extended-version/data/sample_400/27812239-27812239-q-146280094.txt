I using thymeleaf and spring boot to build my web application.
I have problem on internationalization.
I need to change all text on my web application into outer file based (all text include validation).
I have code like this:

error.required=The {0} is required
My web application have 2 validation.
Validation from modal warning and validation from javascript for bootstrapvalidator.
For javascript, it work fine after I implement
But my problem is on thymeleaf.
My question: How do I inject {0} from (The {0} is required) with another string?
NB: I have tried to do something like this but the result is error
