So, how I can change the IDE GUI font family? NOT code font family,
NOT GUI font size, changing the the font FAMILY of GUI (menu, labels,
etc.)
Unfortunately, the ability to specify the font family for the IDE itself is not currently provided in NetBeans. See these NetBeans bug reports requesting the same feature:

  - Bug 114017 - I18N - provide properties/options to change ide global font name and font size
  - Bug 125083 - I18N - IDE's Font/Fontsize can be configured furthest

Where I need to input -J-Dramos.nb.ui.font="MyFavoriteFont,14" in
NetBeans options?
You would provide that information as an argument to NetBeans when it is started. For example, on my Windows 10 machine NetBeans 8.2 is started by this command:
C:\NetBeans82_151\bin\netbeans64.exe
To specify the details for the plugin just append that plugin data as an argument. In my case I installed the plugin, then restarted NetBeans using the plugin with the Papyrus font:
C:\NetBeans82_151\bin\netbeans64.exe -J-Dramos.nb.ui.font="Papyrus,14"
Unfortunately that (very old) plugin did not work for me on NetBeans 8.2, but perhaps it will work in your environment with a different font family.
If the plugin does not work for you either then the only other approach I can suggest is to see how the Dracula theme manages to change the IDE font, then attempt to replicate that without changing the theme.
You can select IDE Log from NetBean's View menu to review startup issues, and problems with the plugin might be logged there.
