Hmmm, creating that NSError and calling localizedDescription yields "The operation couldn’t be completed. No such file or directory"  And that makes sense since at that directory, there is no projectfusion.db3.  I don't understand completely how to get that file into that directory, I thought xcode would just handle it? Thanks for working through this...
