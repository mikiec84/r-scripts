That works beautifully for organization! The only problem is here  Resources res = getResources();
            myString = res.getStringArray(array_city.array1);
            String q = myString[rgenerator.nextInt(myString.length)];
            t1.setText(q);
The "getStringArray" is giving me a error code? it says it cant be a String [] but that doesnt make any sense to me
