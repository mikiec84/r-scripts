The problem is that there aren't any
methods they share.
Well there's your problem right there. You shouldn't be using inheritance here! If you aren't intending to substitute one class for the other they just shouldn't be in a parent-child relationship.
Depending on the needs they should be totally unrelated, templates, or use composition.
EDIT: Based on the code sample, you're inheriting to reuse and I would suggest using composition instead. could be a that is owned by both and . You can put as much/little helper logic into as appropriate.
