I had the very same problem. In my case I needed to do the following sequence:

1.  Add meta tag fot UTF-8:
2.  Open the html file e.g. in Notepad++, select all text and and convert it to UTF-8 without BOM (if there are other files connected with this html e.g. .css or .js do the same with them)
3.  Restart your IDE (in my case VS2017) because your files might be cached and rebuild the project
