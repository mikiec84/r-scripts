One common problem I see with this file previews are that most of them are unable to correctly render jpg's rotated with exif orientation
The second thing is that it's better to use URL.createObjectURL rather then using a base64 dataURL. That also raises an other issue and that is that most developers forget to revoked objectURL's
That is why i have created Screw-FileReader so you can easily call and get a image back with a object url that is automatically revoked and also has a exif auto-rotation built in using canvas.
the third thing i notis with Soltani Neji answer was that when you click dublicate button before the first upload button it dose unexpected things. it don't keep track of the index so well.
Now to my suggestions: Use the attribute instead and just have one button to make it simpler. it also helps to add the to filter out only images
