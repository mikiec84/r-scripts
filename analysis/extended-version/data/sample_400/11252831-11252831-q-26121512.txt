i have this code i found to cut a string into words.
i cant figure out how the while part works. how does it know to extract words without whitespaces to the buf variable?
it seems the extraction operator (>>) is used both to progress bits into the buffer, and to return true for the loop - i just cant figure out how it knows to cut the words by whitespaces.
thanks in advance!
