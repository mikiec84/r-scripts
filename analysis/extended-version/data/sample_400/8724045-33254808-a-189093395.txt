While impact in compilation is minimal, the impact in deployment can be bad. I've just come across an unused import that required a separate library which became a maven dependency. A further transitive dependency problem was fortunately not found, but the war was thicker for no reason. Add to that a superfluous jar in the webapp classloader.
