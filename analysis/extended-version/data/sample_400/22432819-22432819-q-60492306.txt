I have a simple EntityFramework model that I'm trying to filter by using checkboxes.
My model contains 2 properties:
What I'd like to do is to:

1.  Show an index view of all the companies in the database
2.  Show a list of checkboxes corresponding to each of the distinct locations of the companies
3.  Allow a user to select one or more of the checkboxes and submit the form to redisplay the index with the filter to locations applied.
    I'm not sure how best to approach this - I think I need a viewmodel of my Companies and locations, but I'm not sure how to display the list of checkboxes and then filter by them.
