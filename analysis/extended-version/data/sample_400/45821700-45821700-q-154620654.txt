"Program" is a word in my domain. I have a class named for my domain model. What can happen is the entry class gets picked up if I just use in my code, and do not fully qualify it via . The part that troubles me is that this can result in the application compiling and then erroring at runtime.
I am interested in solutions that keep me from compiling an application that will exception at runtime. The best solution I've thought of is renaming the MyNamespace.Program entry class to something else.
Addendum:
This question's original title was "Can I name the .NET Core Program class something else". Unfortunately that resulted in multiple down votes, and some surprisingly opinionated responses to what I thought was a simple question. So instead of asking that question I've rewritten this question as a description of my specific problem, hoping it might be more helpful to anyone who stumbles upon it in the future.
