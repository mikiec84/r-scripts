I want to create a link on a webpage that close current active tab in a browser without closing other tabs in browser. When user click that close link a alert message should appear asking user to confirm with two buttons, "YES" and "NO". If user clicks "YES", close that page and If "NO", do nothing.
How it will be done using html and php?
Thanks
