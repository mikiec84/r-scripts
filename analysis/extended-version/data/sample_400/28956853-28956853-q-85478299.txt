I have three divs and want to "fake" an inset by casting shadows from outside (1px divs) into the larger middle div.
I don't care if we use z-index or not (they could be floated) whatever you think is the best way to solve it.
Why aren't the shadows showing?
The end result should "look" like this:
However, I want the "fake inset" solution with the three divs.
If you still don't understand. The top and bottom divs should cast their shadows into the middle div, so that the result looks like the middle div has two inset shadows.
I could explain why I want to do it this way, but I'd rather keep the question simple.
