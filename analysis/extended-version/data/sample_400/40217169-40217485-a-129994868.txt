Your problem is related to the fact that you rely on the order of the result of [][1] while the order is not guaranteed as stated in the javadoc:

There is no guarantee that the name strings in the resulting array
will appear in any specific order; they are not, in particular,
guaranteed to appear in alphabetical order.
If you want a specific order you should sort the files yourself using [][2].
