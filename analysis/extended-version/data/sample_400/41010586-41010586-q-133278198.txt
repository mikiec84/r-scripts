I am pretty new guy to react/redux.I am little bit confused why my action is not triggering when it is inside map function.It is just a simple tagging system..When user clicked on tag this function simply add to an array but it should also want to check wheather any duplicate values are added.

console.log(this.props.setPostTags),

function setPostTags(data) {
return dispatch(uploadActions.setTagsToPost(data));
}
