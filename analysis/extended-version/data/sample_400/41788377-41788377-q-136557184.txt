As you see, error raised:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/sklearn/decomposition/pca.py", line 86, in assess_dimension
(1. / spectrum_[j] - 1. / spectrum_[i])) + log(n_samples)
ValueError: math domain error
I already know that math domain error is caused when we take logarithm of a negative number ,but I don't understand how can there be a negative number inside the logarithm ?
Can someone tell me what exactly the problem is? Here is the origin code:
The elements in Matrix are all >= 0.
