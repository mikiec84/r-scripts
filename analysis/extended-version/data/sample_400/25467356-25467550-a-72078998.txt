The code chart you found on the internet is actually Windows OEM code page 437, which was never endorsed as a standard. Although it is sometimes called "extended ASCII", that description is highly misleading. (See the Wikipedia article Extended ASCII: "The use of the term is sometimes criticized, because it can be mistakenly interpreted that the ASCII standard has been updated to include more than 128 characters or that the term unambiguously identifies a single encoding, both of which are untrue."
You can find the history of OEM437 on Wikipedia, in various versions.
What was endorsed as a standard 8-bit encoding is ISO-8859-1, which later became the first 256 code points in Unicode. (It's one of a series of 8-bit encodings designed for use in different parts of the world; ISO-8859-1 is specified to the Americas and Western Europe.) So that's what you will find in most computers produced in this century in those regions, although more recently more and more operating systems are converting to full Unicode support.
The value you see for is the result of casting the ISO-8859-1 code from a (signed) (that is, -15) to an . Had you cast it to an , you would have seen -15.
