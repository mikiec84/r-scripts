Is it possible to make a class abstract in C++ without declaring any abstract methods? Currently, I have a Sprite class with a StaticSprite and DynamicSprite subclass. I would like to make the Sprite class abstract.
The problem is that there aren't any methods they share. Well, both StaticSprite and DynamicSprite might share a draw()-method, but the parameters of this method are different so this isn't an option.
Thank you!
