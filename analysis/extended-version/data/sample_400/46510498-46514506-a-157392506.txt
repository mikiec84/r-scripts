You are attempting to log and use the updated value of before it has been set. Take a look at the code you have above:
The code is going to run asynchronously once the network call completes. Immediately after invoking this asynchronous operation, you attempt to use , which will not have been updated yet. Here's a breakdown:

1.  You instruct Angular to make a network call, providing it a function to invoke once the data is returned.
2.  Before Angular has a chance to make the request, you attempt to access , which has not yet been updated and remains as an empty array.
3.  Some milliseconds later, Angular returns with the data and invokes your callback function, which updates but does not update .
    To fix this issue, you need run the relevant code in order. e.g.:
    As you can see, this will ensure that the value of is set correctly before attempting to use it to update your component.
