You can open the file as binary, instead of text (how one does this depends somewhat on the platform), from there you can write the data directly out to disk.  The only real caveat to this is endianess, which can become an issue when moving the files from one architecture to another (x86 to PPC for instance).
Writing binary data to disk is really no harder than writing text, and really, your creativity is key for how you store the data.
