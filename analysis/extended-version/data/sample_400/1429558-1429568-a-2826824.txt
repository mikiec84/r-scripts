Yea, redefine the macros as , and you simplify that. ORing together bit masks is a very common idiom that anyone will recognize. Getting the shift positions out of your face will help a lot. Your code goes from to this This suggestion does assume that the bit-field definitions are used many times more than there are definitions of them.

I feel like there might be some way to use variadic macros for this, but I can't figure on anything that could easily be used as an expression. Consider, however, creating an array literal inside a function generating your constant:
If your compiler is good, it will see that the entire function is constant at compile-time, and inline the resultant value.
