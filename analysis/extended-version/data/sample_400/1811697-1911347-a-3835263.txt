Let me simplyfy my question: I need a
list box with checkbox and textblock.
textblock data context is different
and check box data context is
different. i mean they get their data
from different objects. no idea how to
achieve this...
Create a new class (a ViewModel) which contains the two data contexts (Model1 and Model2) and data bind to it, also known as the MVVM pattern.
