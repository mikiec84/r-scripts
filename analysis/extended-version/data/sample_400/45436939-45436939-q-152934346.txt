first of all I am a beginner with Qt and C++ and this is my first post here so I am open to improvement suggestions, so for you guys this Question might be stupid.
Nevertheless I hope someone can help me fix my problem. I try to construct a promoted QTextEdit Console widget for my Gui in which i redirect all std::cout. For the redirection i mostly followed this tutorial:

My Code looks like this:
myConsoleStream.cpp:
myConsoleStream.h:
I tried to make this class a subclass of an additional class to which I promoted the QTextEdit to.Which looks like this:
Last but not least my Mainwindow Class looks like this:
Now to my Problem:
If I execute this there appears a second QTextEdit in the Left upperhand corner of my Mainwindow, which I dont want to have there. And I cant figure out why this is appearing or where this is created ??
Btw I am using qt5.5 and QtCreator for that matter.
