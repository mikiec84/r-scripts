Borders overlaping isn't possible…
… but, here is how I'll do to create your effect, using only CSS:

  - Multiple s to create the
  - to mix the colors in the corners
    (Note that if you don't use the you can pick which gradients are overlapping the others by playing with their order!)
    Hope it helps.
