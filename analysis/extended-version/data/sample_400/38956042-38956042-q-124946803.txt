I'm trying to understand someones code and they are reading a memory space in the GPIO region (0x4002 0000 - 0x4002 03FF), but it's a higher address than the GPIO registers (they only go to 0x24).
Can you use all the extra space above 0x4002 0024 and below 0x4002 03FFF?  What would happen if this space is read from?
