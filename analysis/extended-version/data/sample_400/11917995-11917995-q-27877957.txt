My GAE app sends email, and I followed Jeff Atwood's excellent article to improve the likelihood of email delivery.
The first two steps are really easy, but setting up a Sender ID record is more challenging.  The article provides a link to a "Wizard" to help do this, but I don't know the answer to many of the questions in the wizard.
I use Google Apps for email so I'm thinking the Sender ID record should be the same for many other people in my situation (Google Apps and GAE users).
Can anyone point me to a Sender ID record for this?
