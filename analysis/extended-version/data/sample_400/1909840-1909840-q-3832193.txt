Can anyone explain why it's not possible to create your own view controller hierarchies using UIKit on the iPhone?
Let me explain: when creating applications using a complex view hierarchy and navigation logic, it's a good idea to have certain views controlled by a dedicated view controller. These controllers can have their own subcontrollers, and so on. All standard stuff really.
So why is the parentViewController property readonly? It's used by UINavigationController and UITabBarController, and many other properties rely on it (for example the navigationController property).
I've seen many people telling us to create our own property for managing view controller hierarchies, but that's a little silly when Apple's own framework uses its own private "you can't touch it" hierarchy model.
