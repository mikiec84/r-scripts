I have an array, , which contains lot of informations:
name, size, quantity, color, id...
I'm using 'for' loops to sort values by color and save the sorted values in a new array, But the values I get in the generated array are false or not right ordered.
In the way to sort , I first created 3 arrays from $items

Then used them as reference to compare to
So echo are displaying the structure that I wanted
Now, when I'm doing a print_r on , I get the right number of array by color (3), but the nested array seems to keep the size and values of his first passage, and then, for the others passages, it replace the old values by the new ones who have the same index... but old values who'll have a bigger index than the new values, will remain the same as for the first passage.
Any Ideas?
