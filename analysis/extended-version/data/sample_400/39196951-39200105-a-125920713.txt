Is cassandra really a good solution if we expect more query situations without primary key columns in where clause?
This is a use case where a priori Cassandra isn't the best solution.
But if you have 250+ millions records, other databases will also meet performance issues.
One solution is to build your own indexes in other tables.
If you don't have too much different type of where clause it should do the trick.
Even if you will have to do several update or select command to update or select a single row, each of these commands should be as fast as the bench you did.
