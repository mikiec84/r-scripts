As a start, there are other GPIO ports that live at every multiple of from and beyond that but still in your range, there are the CRC peripheral, RCC, and Flash controller. The relevant memory map is on page 50 of RM0033 (Rev 3, old version so page number is probably wrong).

0x40023C00 - 0x40023FFF Flash interface register
0x40023800 - 0x40023BFF RCC
0x40023000 - 0x400233FF CRC
0x40022000 - 0x400223FF GPIOI
0x40021C00 - 0x40021FFF GPIOH
0x40021800 - 0x40021BFF GPIOG
0x40021400 - 0x400217FF GPIOF
0x40021000 - 0x400213FF GPIOE
0X40020C00 - 0x40020FFF GPIOD
0x40020800 - 0x40020BFF GPIOC
0x40020400 - 0x400207FF GPIOB
0x40020000 - 0x400203FF GPIOA

The code you have posted, as best I have been able to calculate, does access some unimplemented addresses (), so I'm not sure what's going on there, or if I have miscalculated.
It would be a really bad idea to use peripheral registers as general purpose memory. Not every bit will be R/W, not all addresses may be implemented, and that's not even getting into the fact that you'll be configuring hardware based on application data and not correct register values. The range you've specified includes the flash controller and RCC, both of which are vital to the operation of the microcontroller.
If you are out of memory, there are some memory spaces that you may be able to use as general purpose if they are not already used for another purpose. The STM32F2's have a 4 kB backup SRAM that can be used, though there is some setup required to make it R/W. The USB peripheral(s) also has some RAM built in for endpoint buffers. If you aren't using USB, you could abuse some of this memory, and you could configure the USB peripheral so there aren't any bad side effects.
