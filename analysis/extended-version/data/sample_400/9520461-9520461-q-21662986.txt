I am a fairly new user to MySQL although I am fairly experienced with SQL(DB2 environment).  I am using the workbench to run queries and update statements.  I am having a problem updating data in a table which I have been able to prior.  I am able to select rows but when I go to update based on the same criteria, the return message is:
0 row(s) affected Rows matched: 9 Changed: 0 Warnings: 0
Update gina1.proj001_bcbs set contract_percentage = 1.50
where contract_category = 'All Other Services'
and doctor = 'JSmith' ;
When I run the same WHERE clause with a select I get the correct list of records.
9 row(s) returned  and I get the correct list of data.
select * from gina1.proj001_bcbs
where contract_category = 'All Other Services'
and doctor = 'JSmith' ;
I do not believe I am logging but I can't say for sure, I did ready somewhere about resetting the log.  If someone can help it would be great.
