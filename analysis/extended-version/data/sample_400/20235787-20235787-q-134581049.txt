I have two Models, Doctor and Patient. I have related them each other through HABT.
I want to retrieve associated data of patients from model Doctor.ie I want to retrieve all patients belongs to a specific Doctor in DoctorsController.
I have following code in my DoctorController for index action.
Its working perfectly in 'view' action in same controller but not in 'index' action. I'm looking to display data in index.ctp view of Doctor Controller
I have used this to display in index.ctp but it not working
the '$doctor_profile['Patience']' doesn't return any value. Shouldn't it be returning its related data Patience Model?
