I'm creating the "framework" to control a Hexapod.
So (simplifying) I have a Servo class:
and a child HexBone class:
and also a HexLimb class:
In the HexLimb class whenever I do:
self.femur.setAngle(30) I want to call self.calcPosition() to recalculate the limb's tip position.
I've been searching all over and couldn't found any answer...Am I doing it the wrong way?
