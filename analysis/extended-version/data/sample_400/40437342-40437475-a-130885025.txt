You could also use a one liner with input iterators - the shortest way to read elements in a vector:
See Ideone example here
Assuming however that you wish to ignore all this C++ awesomeness, strongly discouraged IMHO, you can just:
Note that you will:

1.  need to guess the ,
2.  or manually handle reallocation once you read more elements than MAX_SIZE;
    Hence: USE An !!
