I'm writing a getSitemapR handler that uses yesod-sitemap to generate a sitemap file. The issue I'm having is converting a String into UTCTime as defined in Data.Time.Clock, The haddock documentation says that UTCTime instances the Read typeclass, so that's what I'm trying. Here's my code.
I've looked through my copy of Real World Haskell in chapter 20 on system programming, but it doesn't cover UTCTime in it's code samples, I've searched google with the term 'haskell "Convert a String to UTCTime"' with no results. I found the following Thread in the haskell-cafe mailing list which won't work because SitemapLastMod doesn't take a Maybe UTCTime. I think I'm making a really stupid mistake here, but I'm not sure, could someone please point me in the right direction?
Thank you for your time and consideration.
