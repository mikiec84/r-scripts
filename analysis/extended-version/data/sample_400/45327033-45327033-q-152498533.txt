I would like to create a regex for a 24h unix timestamp starting from, say: , which is a difference of 86399 sec. in the unix time stamp format.
I'm using the python lib, but it's buggy for such a huge ranges. The method () would produce a regex of:
This is fine for the static bounds to create the regex, but when it comes to values like: since the 7 digit (9) from the left is not in the third range group ([3-6]).
Can someone provide a better python3 lib or a workaround on how to create a regex for 86400 sec. of a day?
