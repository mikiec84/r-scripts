I'm working on a program that accesses StarTeam using the StarTeam SDK for .NET. And I've noticed that it takes about 10 seconds to login to the StarTeam server. I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to speed that up.
Edit
I used this command to run the StarTeam Cross Platform client with debugging output:
stjava.exe StarTeamCP.stjava -- -netmon
It appears that the delay happens when it send the command SRVR_CMD_GET_USER_PERSONAL_INFO. So I don't think there's anything I can do to speed it up.
