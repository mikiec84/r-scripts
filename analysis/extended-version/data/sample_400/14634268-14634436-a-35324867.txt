I hope I'm understanding this question correctly -
Are you basically asking if there is a natural internal exception to adopt instead of running your own exception?
Or are you just not aware you can do something like:
if i missed the point, let me know and I may update.
As for a reason to not throw your own exceptions... I can't say I know of a real benefit to this. It would seem to me that in_array() is perfectly acceptable and throwing exceptions may just be personal preference and not necessarily a worthwhile concern for performance.
EDIT
Considering my answer and the question, it is noteworthy that this answer was accepted likely due to the conclusion in the comments that PHP does not allow you to declare functions that throw exceptions like Java does. Simply put.
So this answer is to serve only that purpose. Can PHP declare a function that throws an exception? No, not by default. You have to try and catch the exceptions yourself within the function.
