html
I need it so that:

  - When user hover in - appears dropdown menu, and if hovered it stays visible
  - When user changes target (anything else instead and ) - dropdown menu hold 1s and disappear.
    I wrote this jQuery:
    but it does not work correctly, and css transitions are working in mouseover but are not working on mouseout..
    One other question - Is it that mouseover and mouseout functions can be used cross browser or on mobile devices such as iPad?
    Here is JsFiddle Link, I hope you'll help me)
