There are many Ways to do so:

1.  Try debugging the Test instead of just running it. This will case an exception beeing raised at the failing assertion.
2.  You already povided some Messages to your assertions, those will be visible in the test-explorers details-section after selecting the failes test making it easier to determinse which test-case failed (see screenshot below).

3.  As pointed out in the comments, try to have just one assertion per test-case, this way its obvious which assertion failed simply because there is only one within a testcase.
