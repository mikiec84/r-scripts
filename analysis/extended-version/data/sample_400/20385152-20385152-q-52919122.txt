I'm trying to embrace the new PCL fun on a Xamarin.iOS project in Xamarin Studio. I created a PCL "Core" library for my project and added Splat (v0.3.4) via NuGet. Then, in a consuming iOS project, I reference my core library. Once I do that, a couple compile errors show up.
One of these:
Multiple of these:
It looks like this was addressed in an pull request to Splat that landed since v0.3.4 hit NuGet. Following along with the notes there, I added a reference to to the iOS project. When I do, the compile errors change up to complain about too many type definitions.
Is it possible to work around these errors using Xamarin Studio 4.2.1 (Xamarin.iOS 7.0.4.209), and Splat 0.3.4 or do I need to build the latest code with its type-forwarding awesomeness?
