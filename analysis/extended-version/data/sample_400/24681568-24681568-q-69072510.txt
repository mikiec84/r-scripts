I am using X-Editable with AngularJS for Form

There are two criteria, one wherein user should be allowed to update all fields and other where in user will be allowed only to edit role i.e. Select Role.
If I remove editable-text manually from all fields it satisfies second criteria. Is there any way I can add editable-text based on condition.
I tried using ng-disabled and tried removing editable-text attribute using javascript but that did not work.

Any ideas in getting this work.

Thanks in Advance
