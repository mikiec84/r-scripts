I've tried every possible combination (panel closed or opened and navigate to different pages).
The problem is only with the mainpage.

Example: let's say I have the pages , , .
 1) First load, mainpage shown: panel works (close/open all the time you want);
 2) I change page, I go to elist. Panel works.
 3) I go to estats, Panel works.
 4) Repeat 2) and 3) how many times you want, it works.
 5) Go back in mainpage: doesn't work anymore.

Another interesting thing is that if I go again to another page, in that page the panel works. it's only mainpage the problem
