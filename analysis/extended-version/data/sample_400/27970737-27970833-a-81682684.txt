In your case, your function is equivalent to .
And about the binding of the . The return of the function is a r-value (a temporary), and is an r-value reference, so this is expected. Of course, the lifetime of the temporary is extended to the scope of the reference.
BTW, your code, compiled with gives in CLang++:

warning: 'const' type qualifier on return type has no effect [-Wignored-qualifiers]
And in G++:
warning: type qualifiers ignored on function return type [-Wignored-qualifiers]
