Well, you can't exactly return a value from the thread's entry point.
What I would suggest is some kind of async communication between the Server class.
You can define an event in your Server class, something like:
Then, when serverAction is ready, you do something like:
Next, you need to bind to this event from somewhere from the UI (probably the Window).
There you need to just call your code in the UI thread's context, by first checking Dispatcher.CheckAccess and then invoking your UI code.
Something very similar with what is described here.
