I'm working on a small simulation program and I use vis.js to create hierarchical trees. When I do this they are spread out pretty far. Using myNetwork.stabilize() fixes this but the spacing between the trees stays the same and adjusting treeSpacing after I use stabilize() won't work. I've added to sreenshots to illustrate what I mean since it's hard for me to describe it.

I'd like to have the stabilized trees with shorter gaps between individual trees.
