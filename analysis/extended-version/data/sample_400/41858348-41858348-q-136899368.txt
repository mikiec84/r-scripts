I wrote a simple C-code to compute average of N s that exist in an array. I got 10.5 ClockCyles per float as throughput for large N.
is actually poorer in performance.
Isn't this too many CCs/float?
The 3 operations

1.  load-from-memory
2.  accumulation-of-loaded-values
3.  increment of pointer
    can happen in parallel.
    Does ARM Cortex M4F do this?
    The project was run on custom board with Freescale K24 processor having ARM Cortex M4F.
