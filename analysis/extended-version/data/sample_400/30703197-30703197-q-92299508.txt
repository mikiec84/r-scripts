I am getting response to a Ajax request with returned object as data with let says 10-15 parameters.
Now I am adding for each item a table row in master page, how can I pass this data for each item when clicked on other side of details function without making another ajax call or adding all param as data-attributes...
This is what's happening on master panel,
