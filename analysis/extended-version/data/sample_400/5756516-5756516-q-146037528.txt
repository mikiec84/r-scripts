Ok so I asked a question yesterday about doing a timed procedure. I got some responses about using SQL Server Agent but i found out that I am using Sql server 2008 express RC and its not available.
Here is my first question and I want to know if there is another tool I can use to do a timed procedure with sql server ....thanks again
