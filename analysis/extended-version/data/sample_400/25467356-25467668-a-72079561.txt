There  is already plenty of information here. However, I'd like to propose some ideas to adress your inital problem, being the categorisation of extended character set.
For this, I suggest the use of and especially the equivalent of the old isalpha(), isspace(), isprint(), etc...  but taking into accoutn the locale (country specific topics).
Here a little piece of code to help you to find out what chars could be a letter:
This will print out the ascii code from 0 to 255,  folowwed by an indicator if it is a letter according to the local settings,  and the character itself if it's printable.
