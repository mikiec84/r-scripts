Thanks, @JovanPerovic and yoshi.

Well, in my constructor I'm waiting an object with ITestService contract. I should discard any methods that not exists in this contract.

I worked with c# and castle windsor IoC framework and I could only use the methods defined in the interface. It make sense to me, but symfony component confuses me.
