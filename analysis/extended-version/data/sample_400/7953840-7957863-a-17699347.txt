Try and see if it works for Android 4.0. I know I had some issues with the camera in the emulator, in lower version (Lower than 4.0) it just wouldn't recognize my laptop webcam. But when I tried it on 4.0, when the AVD was loading a popup message came and asked me if I want to connect the webcam to the AVD, and once I agreed it worked.
Another poster in SO asked this question too, about the camera, and changing the AVD version to 4.0 did help him.
Maybe its the same for audio recording too, as both are external hardware for the typical PC.
