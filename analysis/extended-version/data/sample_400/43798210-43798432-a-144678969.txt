I don't have a quote from the standard, but cppreference confirms my suspicions:

A non-class non-array prvalue cannot be cv-qualified. (Note: a function call or cast expression may result in a prvalue of non-class cv-qualified type, but the cv-qualifier is immediately stripped out.)
The returned is just a normal prvalue, and makes the non-const overload a better match than the one.
