First, 1000 strings is not a particularly large array size. Whether this is a lot of memory depends on whether the strings are long.
As to picking one at random, the number of elements should not be a factor at all in terms of how long it will take to pick one. Just generate a random integer between 0 and 1000 (exclusive) and pick the one at that index.
