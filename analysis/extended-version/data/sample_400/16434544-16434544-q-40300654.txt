Using the code below, I'm having trouble checking whether a specified date exists in a MySQL 'date' column.
It's returning false, despite the fact that I can see the date '2013-05-08' displayed in phpMyAdmin.
The table itself contains 70+ entries for that date. It always will do, if it contains any at all, but I just want to know whether it exists or not at this stage.
The date field is a MySQL 'date' type. I'm suspecting that the bug is in my structuring of the PDO calling of the query.
UPDATE
Updated to `$s['date']. I suspect that I still have an issue with the structure of that, but probably need to fix the query so that it gives us results before focusing on this.
Also tried running the query against the database directly and got an empty resultset, despite being able to see that the target date exists. Still baffled!
