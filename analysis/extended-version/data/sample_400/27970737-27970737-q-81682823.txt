At least in 'Clang' & 'GCC'. Here is an example:
As most of you probably knows in the second line of 'we are bounding the return-value temporary ('prvalue') into an 'rvalue reference'  thus extending it's life time. So my question is what is happening here - is 'cv' for return-values really ignored and if so where in the standard this is written or else how is converted to ?
*Need ISO C++ standard qualification.
