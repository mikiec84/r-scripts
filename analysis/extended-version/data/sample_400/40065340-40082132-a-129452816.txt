All right, I'm feeling generous. Your example code contains a lot of fluff that should not be in a minimal reproducible example and your call is not portable, but I had a look anyway.
The good news: Your code works as expected.
Let's plot only the bars:
plot 1
Now only the lines:
plot 2
Now compare the scales of the y-axes. If you plot both together, the bars get plotted, but they are so small that you can't see them. You need to rescale:
plot 3
