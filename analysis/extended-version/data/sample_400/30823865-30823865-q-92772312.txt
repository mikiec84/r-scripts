I want to stack the two Font Awesome icons fa-star and fa-star-half, but I am having alignment issues.  See image below:
Attempt to stack fa-star and fa-star-half fails due to alignment of icons

Here is my HTML:
...and my CSS:
Note that I do not want to use fa-star-half-o which has an unappealing design when used with an outline.
I have tried to use "float," but without success.
Any help is appreciated.  Thanks!
Jesse
