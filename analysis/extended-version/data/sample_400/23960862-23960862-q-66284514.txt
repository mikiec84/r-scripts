I tried to copy a local file from hard disk directly to Hadoop directory and got the following results. None of them work. Can anyone help me with the right syntax?
$ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal C:\\temp\\sample_file.txt /user/user_name/sample_file.txt
copyFromLocal: unexpected URISyntaxException
$ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal C://temp//sample_file.txt /user/user_name/sample_file.txt
copyFromLocal: /temp/sample_file.txt': No such file or directory
