Some browsers are more aggressive than others when it comes to caching 'static' resources.
Typically they use URL patterns to cache.
If you are including scripts yourself you can append a date parameter to the script resource url kinda like this: where you dynamically generate a new time stamp every time the page loads (either server side or through JS)
ExtJS automatically adds param to the file resources it loades through loader and any AJAX requests it makes.
