I have developed an android application that stores camera captured images to a mySQL database. I am trying to Store images into Blob field in mySQL database but I am unable to store and retire the data
Since i did not have enough resource to save the images to a file. That why I have adopted this method.
I have used the below class to insert the image in the database.

I have used the below PHP script to insert the image in the database.
In order to retive the values from the datbase i have used the below php code
