this is the code:
import java.awt.;
import java.awt.event.;
import java.applet.*;
import java.util.Vector;

public class PainterNN extends Applet implements MouseListener, MouseMotionListener{
}
}
}
public void mouseReleased( MouseEvent e ) {  // called after a button is released
repaint();
e.consume();
}
public void mouseMoved( MouseEvent e ) {  // called during motion when no buttons are down
e.consume();
}
public void mouseDragged( MouseEvent e ) {  // called during motion with buttons down
int mx = e.getX();
int my = e.getY();
}

}
It should draw circles at mouse drag but it didn't. Why?
