My GAE app sends email, and I followed Jeff Atwood's excellent article to improve the likelihood of email delivery.
The first two steps are really easy, but setting up a Sender ID record is more challenging.  The article provides a link to a "Wizard" to help do this, but I don't know the answer to many of the questions in the wizard.
I use Google Apps for email so I'm thinking the Sender ID record should be the same for many other people in my situation (Google Apps and GAE users).
Can anyone point me to a Sender ID record for this?
EDIT:
This page explains how to set the SPF and SenderID record for Amazon SES, and gives the following TXT record for SPF:
and the following TXT record for SenderID:

Leontx's answer appears to give an SPF record and not a SenderID record.
Also, when I look at the headers of the email I send with GAE, there are notes saying that SPF authentication passes even though I haven't added either of the above TXT records to my domain.  There is no info in the headers about SenderID.
I'm still confused about this, but I will now be using Amazon SES to send email.  It is really cheap and it seems that Amazon takes a lot more care than Google to help make sure that email gets delivered.
