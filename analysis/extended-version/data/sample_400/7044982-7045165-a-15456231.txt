As it's been pointed out, you can't reliable get the keywords without supplying the parameters to look for. Here's what I would do:
Basically all this does is parse the url using PHP's [][1] and look for the parameter q. If it's not there, it uses ssearch, and then oq. You can add more of them if you need to. If by the end of it it's not found, $query_str will be NULL.
