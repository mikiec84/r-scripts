Using the code below, I'm having trouble checking whether a specified date exists in a MySQL 'date' column.
It's returning false, despite the fact that I can see the date '2013-05-08' displayed in phpMyAdmin.
The table itself contains 70+ entries for that date. It always will do, if it contains any at all, but I just want to know whether it exists or not at this stage.
The date field is a MySQL 'date' type. I'm suspecting that the bug is in my structuring of the PDO calling of the query.
