I'm trying to get the sum of a column if their ISBN is the same and the shipdate is null. Shipdate is in a different table so it seems that " and shipdate is null" portion does not properly get checked, in fact they all seem to be counted as not null which is not true.
I've tried another method
but it has an outer reference so it won't work. Any help is greatly appreciated.
