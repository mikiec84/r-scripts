When a WebApp is idle for along time IIS will close the application to save resources. This might have happened in your case.
Its also said that the application would turn off if the last user session timed out. I hope this article will guide you properly.
Look at what happens when the request gets to the runtime.

1.  When ASP.NET receives the first request for any resource in an
    application, a class named ApplicationManager creates an application
    domain. (Application domains provide isolation between applications
    for global variables, and allow each application to be unloaded
    separately.)
2.  Within an application domain, an instance of the class named Hosting
    Environment is created, which provides access to information about
    the application such as the name of the folder where the application
    is stored.
3.  After the application domain has been created and the Hosting
    Environment object instantiated, ASP.NET creates and initializes
    core objects such as HttpContext, HttpRequest, and HttpResponse.
4.  After all core application objects have been initialized, the
    application is started by creating an instance of the
    HttpApplication class.
5.  If the application has a Global.asax file, ASP.NET instead creates
    an instance of the Global.asax class that is derived from the
    HttpApplication class and uses the derived class to represent the
    application.
