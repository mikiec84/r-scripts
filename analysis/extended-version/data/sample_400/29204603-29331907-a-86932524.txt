I encountered the same problem and solve it by adding missing references to a dummy project.

1.  Create 'dummyProject' (ie class library)
2.  In Visual Studio - Package Manager Console
3.  In Sandcastle Help Fil Builder - Project Explore, add two references
    It looks like  MRefBuilder found that Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Owin relies on Microsoft.Owin (== v 2.1.0) and not Microsoft.Owin (>= 2.1.0).
    The main project is still using Microsoft.Owin 3.0.1.0
