I use and store there. Tried to serialize the using Newtonsoft.Json, it only saves the text. Wanted to keep the image in the form of bytes, but have not found how to convert to .
In general I have two questions:

1.  Has the of images to be serialized to a file?
2.  How can I convert a into a byte array?
    The issue relates to the UWP platform, I would appreciate any help.
