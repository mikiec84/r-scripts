I have an array, $items, which contains lot of informations:
name, size, quantity, color, id...
I'm using 'for' loops to sort $items values by color and save the sorted values in a new array, But the values I get in the generated array are false or not right ordered.
In the way to sort $items, I first created 3 arrays from $items

Then used them as reference to compare to $item
So echo are displaying the structure that I wanted
But when I'm applying a print_r on $sorted_items, I get 4 arrays whereas 3 (3 colors), and worst, color rows have a false value and the other values inside the sub arrays are not in the same order as displayed in the echo...
Any Ideas?
