I have an asp.net web application running on an IIS 7.5/.NET Framework 4.0 server.  Whenever I navigate to any webpage running on this server, it takes about 12 seconds to initially load.  After that, navigation is quick (about 0.5 seconds, even on heavy hitting pages).  If you leave it idle for two minutes, it slows again for the next request.  I can tell that this is because the connection time-out is set to 120 seconds...I am guessing that after that limit, the site must reload everything when the next page is requesting.  This site does call two different databases, however, default page should not do so and suffers the long initial load time.  I have tried setting up Application Initialization for IIS 7.5, but noticed very marginal change at best after this was done.  From what I've been reading, there seems to be very mixed success with this module in IIS 7.5.  Is there any other means of circumventing this load time without having to rely solely on a high connection timeout value, since that would not resolve initial load time anyway?
