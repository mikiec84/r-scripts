I've already create a collection in mongo db with several documents and I want to insert to that documents a list of integers. I've found the function insert. My code for pymongo is the following:
follower_list a function that returns a list of ids. The above code seems not to working since it doesn't create a new item in already defined collection. I want add this list into a document which already exists in collection and has the specified id.
