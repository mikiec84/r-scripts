I have the following models:
Each has defined by the User. For Example: Question - What is the best fruit? Options - Apple, Orange, Grapes. Now other user's can the question with their responses restricted to .
I have the following view:
For each option in o, I am receiving an answer count. For example:
Question - What is the best fruit?
Option - Grape, Orange, Apple
Answer - Grape: 5votes, Orange 5votes, Apple 10vote.
What is the best way to calculate the vote percentage for each option out of the total number of votes for that question?
In other words, I want something like this:
Answer - Grape: 5votes 25%votes, Orange 5votes 25%votes, Apple 10vote 50%votes.
