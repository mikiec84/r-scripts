I have Created this code in a custom component that I made:
The first code displays the datetime correctly, but the second one displays the time +3 hours
I have checked the configuration.php file and the public $offset = 'Europe/Athens'; and is correct. I am also changing the settings from the system configuration menu but nothing seems to be fixing the JFactory::getDate() to display the correct time.
What am I missing?
