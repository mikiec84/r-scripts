I am trying to use custom json encoded data after firing an error on server
(throwing error intentionally) under jquery ajax request.
I don´t understand what is wrong, because the header is right and the data arrives. But it seems that the exception arguments are not passed to the exception callback in javascript.
The php code
The javascript code
Response from server
But the alert is undefined instead Bad Format.
What is wrong ?¿
