you can create anservices "Context" where you write your  "active image" path.
so that you don't need using state parameters.
moreOver this not resolve why $index is imutable...
sevices exemple :
inject it in your card controller  :
and in your full screen :

use alias is a good practice.
but if it disturb you, you can publish you var on $scope.  (me => $scope).
except in services, who have not $scope of course
