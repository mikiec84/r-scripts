The total number of rows is correctly showing in pagination but Pagination is not updating the view when the next button is clicked.
I'm new to Sencha. In Mysql, I'm returning all rows. So that I can limit in client side. If I limit the rows in backend, I cannot have all the rows in client side.
View: List.js
Store: Personnel.js
