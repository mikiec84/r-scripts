I have multiple form application. Form 1 is Login form for user validation. Form1 goes to Form2(Menu form). Form 2 leads to Form3 which is only popupform and hides the form2 when it is open.Form 3 goes to Form 4. Now from Form4 ,with button click, I need to restore the Form2 without creating a new instance. I tried using singelton approach, getting error.Code as follows as described above.
Form1:
private void click_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{

if ((user.Text == username) && (pswd.Text == password))

{
Form2:
private static Form2 instance;
private void button_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
Form3:
private void button_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)

Form4:

private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)

{
Mainmenu does not contain a reference for Instance and no extension method accepting a first argument of type 'Mainmenu'

    }

Basically, I want to restore the Form2 that was hided.Any help would be appreciated!Thanks
