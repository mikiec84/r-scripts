Handling PreviewMouseRightButtonUp instead of Down gets the desired effect for me (selection must be done on up instead of down?).
The msdn page for PreviewMouseRightButtonDown says its routing strategy should be 'Direct' and the Routed Events Overview page says:

Tunneling events are also sometimes referred to as Preview events,
because of a naming convention that is used for the pairs.
So maybe tunneling events are generally preview events, but it doesn't really say that preview events have to be tunneling ;)
Edit:
Looking at the other events like PreviewMouseDown vs MouseDown they are Tunneling and Bubble though, maybe just the Right/Left button events are done as direct.
