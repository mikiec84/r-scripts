In what kind of action you want this process? The file should only be really deleted if you persist the $banner object with an action redirect or manually with the PersistenceManager.
Maybe you can also clone the ObjectStorage and then detach some objects.
In this solution all files should remain in $banner but UID4 is removed inside $files variable.
UPDATE: See comments below. The deleted=1 was caused by @cascade remove annotation inside the model.
