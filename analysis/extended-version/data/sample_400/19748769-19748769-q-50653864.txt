So i have this problem where i want input 5-digits and be sure that it's 5 digits.
If it's lower, it'd say, you don't have enough digits
If it's higher, it'd say, you have too many digits.
Also if you would input Char with the digits, it would say, that it's not valid.
This is what i got so far and where im stuck at.
I also want to know if their's a way to say
input > 5digits length.
Also, overall it keeps saying "else without if" case,default, or } expected on the first else if line.
tl;dr : My question would be, is there a way to input 5 digits and recognize them as digits, if it's higher or lower, and if their's any character in them, also how to loop it up so it'll repeat until 5 digits are entered under the corresponding criteria.
