I am trying to build a stored procedure in SQL.
I have the following syntax:
How do I tell the procedure in which table the columns and are?
I have tried and various attempts with and but it doesn't seem to work.
Eventually, this procedure will be called upon by a C# datareader.
What I am trying to do is build a procedure that, when called upon, will return the selected cells from a row, depending on the information in specific cells:

  - If is not null, then I want to get it.
  - If it's null, I want to get instead.
  - If THAT's null as well, I want to get back a message that no contact information is available (a string which I have placed in ).
    Am I going about this the right way?
