I made a script in order to create this "slideshow":
yet I can not go back to the last slide if I hit "previous" when it is on the first slide
I tried using the last-child selector but had no success
I also tried resetting the count directly like so:
I've been stuck with this for two days, I'm trying to understand what I'm doing wrong!
all I what's left to do is to go to the last slide if I hit "previous" while I'm "standing" on the first slide
