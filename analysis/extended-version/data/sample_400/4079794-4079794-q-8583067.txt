i'm trying to build a general purpose template function which should function with 2 different type of structure i'll write an example
then in main:
now , this is a short example of my issue where i'm handling much more complicated structures, anyway what i get is
error: 'struct sa' has no member named 'd'
the problem is that the gnu c++ compiler didn't recognize that not all operations in the function are execute when struct sa is passed, and d is printed only when sb is passed,
how i can fix this without creating a duplicated function 1 for each structure type?
thank you :)
