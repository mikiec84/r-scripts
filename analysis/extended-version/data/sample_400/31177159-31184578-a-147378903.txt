A client hook is tricky, as:

  - it can be bypassed by a client, and
  - is not easily deployed on all clients.
    A server hook is easier (update hook), since it receives a zero sha for new refs.
    That same hook can list the content of a commit
    If a specific folder is still there, it can reject the push with an helpful message.
