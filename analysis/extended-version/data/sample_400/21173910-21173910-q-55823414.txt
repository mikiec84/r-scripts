I want to create a web application in IIS that does not live at the root of the IIS site.
i.e. MySite/beta/WebApplication.
This is my starting point:
>New-WebApplication "WebApplication" -Site "MySite" -ApplicationPool "MyAppPool" -PhysicalPath "C:\Sites\MySite\beta\WebApplication"
That creates me the physical structure I want , but makes IIS look like this:

MySite (IIS Web Site)

WebApplication (IIS WebApplication)
beta (Folder)

WebApplication (Folder)
Is there a way this can be done via powershell?  I do not really want to be a web application, just a folder.
