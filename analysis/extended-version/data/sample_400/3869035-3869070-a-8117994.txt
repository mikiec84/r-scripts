The code seems to work fine for me. Can you provide more context, such as the content of strings you're passing to it, and what locale you're using?
A few other bugs/style issues I noticed:

  - is left as the allocated length, rather than updated to match the length in (wide) characters. Is that your intention?
  - The cast to is useless and bad style.
    Edit: Upon discussion, it looks like you may be using a nonconformant Windows version of the function. If so, your question should be updated to reflect as such.
