Is it possible to introduce a fresh variable with forall or something
Unfortunately not. That way lies impredicativity and there is no good story for it in Haskell.
Computation via type families will get stuck as soon as it inspects a variable. You will have to encode (row) variables of your guest language as concrete types to do anything with them.
