I'm developing an application using GWT 2.6.
Now I have a task to implement a functionality to switch between simple/expert modes (of view) at run-time. It means to show a simplified version of view which may contain another widgets.
But the problem is that all the views in most cases are "static" and defined as singletons (using GIN).
Is it possible to implement this using only GWT and what should I use to make it?.
