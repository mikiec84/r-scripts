I have a table with a Decimal degrees (-22.541100,30.719333) field. I altered the table and added a spatial data column (POINT) to the table. I am trying to update the POINT field with the point value of the Decimal degrees field but cannot get it to work.
This is my sql:
SELECT @loc:= REPLACE(coordinates, ',', ' ') FROM interventions;
UPDATE interventions SET location = GeomFromText('POINT('@loc')');
I keep on getting an error:
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '@loc')')' at line 1
Can anyone see what I am doing wrong?<U+FEFF>
