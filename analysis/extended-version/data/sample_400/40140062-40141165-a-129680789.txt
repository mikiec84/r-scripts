A function returns by default. The use of is therefore only necessary if you want to override the default behaviour.

Why most leave it out when they can
The Javascript community seem to dislike unnecessary verbose code. It might even be said to be a sport to make the code as short and compact as possible.
Why this may not be the best practice for all
The habit of always using return may serve as a good reminder that a function always returns something and thereby remind you to reflect on whether the default behaviour should be overrided.
However an experienced programmer will have such considerations deeply internalized and therefore rarely have need for such reminders.
Conclusion
As one gains experience the sport for less verbose code intensifies and in that context writing code just confirming default behaviour is an absolute no-go.
So: in the long run I would say most people end up leaving it out and that it is justified to do so because of the high degree of internalization.
