I'm going to have unknown number of prompt dialogs.
I will have their number after some user actions, but I want to create them, display them and at the end check if some of them is .
I'm looking for ideas how to do that.
Can I do it without loop?
Something like:
and then check if some of them is empty?
And can I declare array in shorthand way like in PHP and C#?
