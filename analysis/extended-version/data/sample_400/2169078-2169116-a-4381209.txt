You can also do a combination of things.  You could use observers for one action, and if there is just a single email for one other action you could use option #1 for it.
Have you heard of acts_as_state_machine, or any other similar solutions?

They allow you to define a state of each object and different things that can happen with state changes.
This allows you to have as much logic as you need about when things are sent, if you need this much.  Can be overkill, but can be really handy.
