I'm reading this article (about memory leaks which mentions this as a memory leak:

JavaScript interpreter has no idea which variables may be required by
the inner function, so it keeps everything. In every outer
LexicalEnvironment. I hope, newer interpreters try to optimize it, but
not sure about their success.
The article suggests we need to manually set before we return the inner function.
Does this hold true today? Or is this article outdated? (If it's outdated, can someone point me to a resource about current pitfalls)
