You have to know the binary file format for the file you are trying to create.  Consider Joel's post on this topic: the 97-2003 File Format is a 349 page spec.
Nearly all the time, to do something like that, you use an API, to avoid the grunt work.  Be careful however, because trial and error and figuring out "what works" by trial and error can result in an upgrade of the program breaking your code.  Plus you have to take into account other operating systems, minor version differences, patches, etc.
