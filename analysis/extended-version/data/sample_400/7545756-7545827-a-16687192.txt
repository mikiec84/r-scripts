In the asterisk is a greedy quantifier and matches as many characters as it can, so it only stops at the last it finds.
You can either use to make it lazy, or (better IMO), use to make the match explicit:
You might still need to escape the quotes if you're building the regex from a string; otherwise that's not necessary since quotes are no special characters in a regex.
