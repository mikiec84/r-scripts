The problem is you connect a handler to the element, after which it does not matter if the class changes.
Use a delegated handler attached to a non-changing ancestor:
is the default if no other element is handy, but never use for delegated events as it has a bug (if styling results in a calculated body height of 0 it will not respond to mouse events).
