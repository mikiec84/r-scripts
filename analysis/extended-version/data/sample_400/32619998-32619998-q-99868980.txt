I'm attempting to throw together a Python script which accepts several variables and outputs a price based on a target profit margin (percentage).
If I come up with a price I can calculate the percentage margin on it. For example, let's say I have a product that I am listing for .

  - Item cost:
  - Marketplace cost: 10% of $49 ()
  - Payment processor cost: 2.9% ()
  - Total costs: ($49 - $14 - $4.90 - $1.42)
  - Total profit: ($49 - $20.32)
  - Calculated profit margin: 41.49% ((100 / 49) * 20.32)
    However, when attempting to flip the problem and generate a price based on cost, profit margin, marketplace pecentage and payment processor percentage, I'm at a complete loss on how to solve this.
    Has anyone else tackled this problem and if so, do you have any pointers or would you provide a solution for me to work from to better understand how to tackle these sorts of challenges in the future?
    Examples don't necessairily have to be in Python, that just happens to be the language I'm working in.
