I'm having a weird issue here it seems. I have an interface, known as . I then have another class, like so:
However when I go to make another class, called , like so:
When doing the following in a JUnit test:
I receive the following error:

The constructor LeftSort(List<Foo>) is undefined.
I swear you're able to use interfaces in generics like I have done so. Is there anything I've done wrong here?
Edit: Please make note in the future to check which class your actually importing prior to complaining like me. I simply had the wrong class imported (Foo is just the name I gave it online, it was actually Test that I so smartly decided to use...)
