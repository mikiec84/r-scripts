Does it take 10 seconds every time for every user or is it just the first time for the first user?
If it's the latter then this sounds like the initial JIT is slowing down start up. If so there are plenty of solutions out there.
Otherwise I'd look at profiling any database queries that go along with logging in.
In other words, try to break down the time taken to do each part of the log in process and when you find a significant chunk of time try to reduce or eliminate it.
