Good day to all, I'm having a problem on my crystal report. Here is my table links table link

My problem is when tbltransaction doesn't contain any data tblAccount and tblAcctDetails won't show any data either, is there a way to display tblAccount and tblAcctDetails data even if tblTransaction does not have any data on it?
