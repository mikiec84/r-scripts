I've seen a lot of topics on the panel element of JQM, but I don't see anything similar so here's the question.
I have different pages (with different ids), each with its own panel element:
And the event bound to call the a function with the following code:
Now, for all the other pages the navigation is OK and the panel works without problems.
The only problem I have is when I go back to index.html (the first page loaded, page with id ).
It's strange because I see the code executed correctly: , but the panel is not shown.
Any hints?
UPDATE: Just to test, I've created a new entry page, so index.html is not anymore the first page loaded. In this way the panel in index.html works correctly. It was just to completely exclude some unexpected behaviors related to the page. So the problem is exactly that it's the first page loaded.
Thanks,
Lorenzo
