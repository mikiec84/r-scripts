First, I created this utility in order to debug my situation:
This utility is used in order to confirm I am not getting an expected set of data back when reading values just drawn. I expect to get value matching what was just drawn. Here is the drawing code:
In my test case ant.size.width is 5. That should produce a line drawn wide enough that when I query the color, I should get the same color back. Here is the method for querying color:
I realize this method is creating a color from a different mode, RGB, than what was written, HSB, but since I'm using the same context for both, I would think this shouldn't matter. Maybe there's some other setting I need to set?
Here is the method that creates the context:
Here's a sampling of some data. The app selects random colors, alternating the hue by adding the golden ratio each time a new color is needed and then normalizing to 0..1. In the run I just did, the color created was:
created using the following code:
The values of hue and saturation are created at initialization time of the ant but remain constant throughout that object's life. In any case, here is output from drawing and querying using a color that appears light cyan-blue on the screen:
Hmmm. Now that I look at it, it seems there may be an endian issue. Looks like red and blue are backward.
