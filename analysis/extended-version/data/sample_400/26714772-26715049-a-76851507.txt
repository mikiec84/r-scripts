With such a wide spectrum of things crashing, I suspect that it is something "systemic" with your Java installation.  Maybe you installed from a corrupted installer (or whavever), or maybe the installation has been "messed with".
And if it isn't that, then the next place to look is either:

  - some JVM bug that is particular to your platform (e.g. OS, window manager, video device, etc), or
  - hardware errors (!).
    The best thing I can suggest is that you enable core dumping (per the instructions), and see what you get.  This page may help you diagnose the dump ... as may googling.
    And if you have a support contract, call Oracle for help.
