It's not just g++.  That's invalid C++.  Every statement in a function (template or not) must be valid, even if you can "prove" it's not executed.
What's so bad about giving them separate functions?  Of course, you can deal with some common subparts by calling another subfunction.
If you want the functions to have the same name, go ahead and do that.  Function overloading will handle it.
