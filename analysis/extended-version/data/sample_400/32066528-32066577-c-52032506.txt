Holly cow! I'm really so dumb that I can't copy a text, or this technology is f***ed up? For the good of human kind, it'll be better to be the first one! It doesn't work! It still stays as "blah" and it doesn't change as needed. I'm re-posting the entire html doc in the first post. Please have a look at it, maybe I'm using the wrong bs version, or the wrong jquery version? Thanks a lot!
