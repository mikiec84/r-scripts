I'm learning R and I have a dataset with about 6,000 daily records of three weather variables. I'm interested in knowing the mean and sd for each variable for each season in each year. I've found a bunch of different ways to break the data down into subsets. However, I can't figure out how calculate these without typing in mean(s1997$tmax) & sd(s1997$tmax) for each one. I would like to produce something that looks like this:
Season    mean.TMAX   sd.TMAX   mean.TMIN   sd.TMIN
s1997
f1997
w1997
s1998
I'm not even sure that R can do this though.
