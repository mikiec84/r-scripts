I wrote simple C-code to compute average of N float s that exist in an array. I got 10.5 ClockCyles per float as throughput for large N.
The arm_mean_f32() is actually poorer in performance.
Isn't this too many CCs/float ?
The 3 operations

1)  load-from-memory
2)  accumulation-of-loaded-values
3)  increment of pointer
    can happen in parallel. Does ARM Cortex M4F do this ?
    The project was run on custom board with Freescale K24 processor having ARM Cortex M4F.
    Thanks.
