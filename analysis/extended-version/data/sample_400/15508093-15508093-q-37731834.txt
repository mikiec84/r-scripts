I'm using Ruby Sequel (ORM gem) to connect to a Postgres database. I'm not using any models. My insert statements seem to have a "returning null" appended to them automatically (and thusly won't return the newly inserted row id/pk). What's the use of this? And why is this the default? And more importantly, how do I disable it (connection wide)?
Also, I noticed there's a dataset.returning method but it doesn't seem to work!
Don't know if it matters but the table in question is inherited (using postgres table inheritance)
