The desired extraction result is in this case obviously:
My first idea was to use because:

  - matches the body element, wherever it is
  - matches the first child of the body element
  - matches all descendants or self of the current element
    I figured that would work but on the example provided, the XQuery gives no results.
    However, I read up a bit and found the following (source:
    So I changed my XQuery to and this time, the results were correct.
    My question: what is the difference between // and descendant-or-self::node()? What I found here (and here (says:

is short for . For example, is
short for .
Which leads me to conclude that and are not interchangeable (probably because of the terminating at the end?), but then can someone tell me if there is a shorthand for ?
