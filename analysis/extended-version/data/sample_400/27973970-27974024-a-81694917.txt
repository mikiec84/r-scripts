The problem is you connect a handler to the element, after which it does not matter if the class changes.
Use a delegated handler attached to a non-changing ancestor:
Delegated events work by listening for the event to bubble up at an ancestor element. They then apply the jQuery filter at event time (not event registration time) to the elements in the bubble-chain. They then apply the function only to matching elements that caused the event.
documentbody` for delegated events as it has a bug (if styling results in a calculated body height of 0 it will not respond to mouse events).
