You shouldn't have any of this issues, if you declare your namespaces correctly.
This may confuse the compiler as may be defined in and in .
The later one shouldn't cause any confusion issues, because if you have ambiguous/conflicting names, the compiler will take it from the inner using and if it doesn't find it there, look at the outer usings.
###On a side note
doesn't sound like a very good name for a domain model, /(Software) or (TV) etc. imho
