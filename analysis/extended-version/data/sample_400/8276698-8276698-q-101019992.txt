I am having an Android Activity which I want to connect with MYSql database with JSP page as middle layer to accept values from android and do query on databse.
Problem is I'm not able to send parameter values from Android Activity to JSP page. Application crashes as Emulator starts. I have given permission for internet in manifest file, This catches exception.
