I am trying to pass a Javascript varaible into a URL,but there seem to exist some sort of syntax error.
Javascript Code
The var kml is basically the kml file name which is stored on the server within the folder KML and I am trying to access that file in order to add a KML layer on my google map.
The URL syntax seems to be incorrect, Any help would be appreciated.
