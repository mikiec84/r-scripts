I just installed the Xcode 4/iOS SDK 4.3 bundle from the apple dev center. I renamed /Developer to /Developer3 before installing. Anyway, after opening up my 3.x xcode project I wanted to change the target, so I clicked on the project at the top of the left hand side tree, and I got an "Internal Error." (Details, Continue or Crash). So I clicked "Details" and saw:
Earlier I also tried going to "Edit Scheme..." but it just sat there and didn't do anything, like I never clicked the menu item.
Has anyone else seen this or know of a workaround?
Thanks.
Update:
So, I uninstalled Xcode 4.0/iOS 4.3 using the uninstall script, then renamed my old Developer3 folder back to Developer and ran that uninstall script... rebooted, re-installed Xcode 4.0/iOS 4.3 and rebooted again, and still am getting the crash. I think it must be something in the project's .plist that I'm trying to open, since I can actually open the project editor with other projects. Hmm.
