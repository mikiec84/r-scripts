These is my django URLconf:
urlpatterns = patterns('',
('^hello/$', hello),
(r'^polls/$', 'mysite.polls.views.index'),
(r'^polls/(?P<poll_id>\d+)/$', 'mysite.polls.views.detail'),
(r'^polls/(?P<poll_id>\d+)/results/$', 'mysite.polls.views.results'),
(r'^polls/(?P<poll_id>\d+)/vote/$', 'mysite.polls.views.vote'),
(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
)
I dont understand what the r in this regex does:
r'^polls/$
I dont understand what this Regex does:
(?P<poll_id>\d+)
And I dont understand why in:
(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls))
There is no $ sign and it still works.
AND
I dont understand what URLconf I have to add, to see a site under
Thanks for the time!
Best
L.
