I have an infopath form where i can attach pdf files. The attachment can be viewed only if i chose download from the attachment icon. I am unable to view the pdf by just clicking on the attachment. How to add this feature so that the user simply clicks on the attachment to download/view the file.
Thanks!
P.S: This is a browser enabled form hosted in my sharepoint site.
