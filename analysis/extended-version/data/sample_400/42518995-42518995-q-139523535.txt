I have a line of SQL that results in 2 rows of 1 cell coming back:
Results:

I am trying to concatenate them together so they look like this 'TESTTEXT[H400]':
However, I am getting a bunch of errors saying that the column names are wrong.
I think this is because both cells come from the same column.
What am I doing wrong and how do I fix it?
