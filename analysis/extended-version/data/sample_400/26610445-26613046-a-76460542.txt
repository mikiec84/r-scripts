Notice the presence of the name in the error message you received. In Maple the name has no special meaning in 1D Maple Notation input.
Presumably you just stuck those calls to in because you were trying to resolve your issue with . In your example the floats have enough contagion to make the calls unnecessary.
You might also be interested in these two variants to obtain an actual float from your formula. I leave out the unnecessary calls here.
Here is defined as an expression.
And here is defined as an operator.
