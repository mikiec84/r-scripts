Your code sets up a strong linear damping, but never releases it, so when the ball reaches a specific speed, it will switch to a state in which it behaves like it's glued.
I would rather limit the maximum speed by checking and resetting it if necessary in every frame:

How linear damping works

Linear damping imitates the phenomenon called drag when the objects moves not too fast. It is basically described by the following equation in every moment:
