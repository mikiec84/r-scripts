Based on Hamcrest Github

  - Hamcrest Github CHANGES.txt
  - Decouple the evolution of Hamcrest and JUnit
  - Is this still being maintained?

and JUnit Lambda (Junit 5)

  - Minimize dependencies (especially third-party)
    My take on it
  - hamcrest-junit 2.0 (should be) is a fresh start with also the goal to decouple hamcrest from junit
  - in the meantime Junit 5 project kicked off which (also wants to) reduce/remove third party dependencies
    => In this situation, I expect it is prudent for the hamcrest guys to wait for / coordinate with the JUnit 5 project before moving forward substantially.
    As @heenenee mentioned, the hamcrest guys became busy with other stuff and so not much is happening with the project at this point.
    To answer

Can somebody explain me the connection between them? Because it seems that hamcrest-junit 2.0 has everything build in from hamcrest 1.3

  - hamcrest-junit 2.0 started but the guys behind it got busy soon after (and still are) with other projects, so the development stopped
  - there might also be some uncertainties regarding JUnit 5 which may be an incentive to defer further hamcrest-junit 2.0 development until the JUnit 5 release (speculation)

... but I do not feel really comfortable. Because I can just find people writing about 1.3 and can not really find the use of hamcrest-junit 2.0.
At the moment, other than for your case there is not much incentive to move to hamcrest-junit 2.0. Once Junit 5 releases I expect that there will be more incentive to move forward again.
