I've seen a lot of topics on the panel element of JQM, but I don't see anything similar so here's the question.
I have different pages (with different ids), each with its own panel element:
And the event bound to call the a function with the following code:
Now, for all the other pages the navigation is OK and the panel works without problems.
The only problem I have is when I go back to index.html (the first page loaded, page with id ).
It's strange because I see the code executed correctly: , but the panel is not shown.
Any hints?
Thanks,
Lorenzo
