I have two pythons installed on my ubuntu

1.  
2.  (anaconda).
    And both pythons have ipython installed in it. When I run (anaconda) it simply takes me to the browser and works perfectly. But, when I run it like  (calling from systems python) it gives me an error. I want run ipython in browser in both cases.
    What I do:
    Snapshot what I did!
