I'm using C# as my programming language for this tryout.
I've searched through countless forums and other places that popped up on my Google search result. However, I cannot find a solution to my question.
I have a FileExplorer and I have the menu items Copy/Paste/Delete in my Context Menu Strip component. Now, I have Copy working for files in my File Explorer, but I'm trying to figure out how to copy folders.
I'm using the TreeView component as my primary component that this is tied to.
What is a File Explorer? Here is what I'm talking about (This is an actual image of my File Explorer):
enter image description here
Here is my current code for copying 'files' inside of my "FileExplorer" folder. It also retrieves other folders/files inside of the 'FileExplorer' folder.

Help would be appreciated if someone could give me the needed pointers/code on how to Copy a folder inside of my File Explorer!
