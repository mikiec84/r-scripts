I need to change the Secure Simple Pairing mode programmatically, but I can't figure out how to set SSP mode on or off in Bluez using a DBus command.
Using utility, I just do:
Ok, but what I need is rather DBus method calls that I can include in my application.
But the Bluez documentation doesn't seem to mention any DBus method to change the SSP mode.
Does anyone know how to do that? (a or example would be just great).
Or is this just impossible?
