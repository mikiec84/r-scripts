I'm trying to apply Unsynchronized's answer (Drawing waveform with AVAssetReader) while using ARC. There were only a few modifications required, mostly release statements.  Many thanks for a great answer!  I'm using Xcode 4.2 targeting iOS5 device.
But I'm getting stuck on one statement at the end while trying to invoke the whole thing.
Method shown here:
On the call to initWithMPMediaItem I get the following error:
Since I do have the method initWithMPMediaItem declared in the class header, I really don't understand why I'm getting this error.
Been trying to wrap my head around this for several hours now but to no avail. Is my method declaration wrong for this type of method? Thanks!
