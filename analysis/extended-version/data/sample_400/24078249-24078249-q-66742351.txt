I'm following this tutorial:
My code:
The issue is, this part of the code throws me an exception:

{"Could not load file or assembly
'Microsoft.Threading.Tasks.Extensions.Desktop, Version=1.0.16.0,
Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its
dependencies. The system cannot find the file
specified.":"Microsoft.Threading.Tasks.Extensions.Desktop,
Version=1.0.16.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a"}
PS.: While most likely irrelevant to the issue, when setting up my project on google to get the credentials, I've selected Installed Application -> Other (As I'm assuming that's what a console application is)
EDIT: Adding seems to have solved that issue. Now the remained of my code:
returns an empty line, even though when I run the application it does request access to my calendar and such. Am I forgetting something?
