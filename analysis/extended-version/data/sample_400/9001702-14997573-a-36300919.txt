The folder being password protected has nothing to do with PHP!
The method being used is called "Basic Authentication". There are no cross-browser ways to "logout" from it, except to ask the user to close and then open their browser...
Here's how you you could do it in PHP instead (fully remove your Apache basic auth in or wherever it is first):
login.php:
index.php
logout.php:
Obviously this is a very basic implementation. You'd expect the usernames and passwords to be in a database, not as a hardcoded comparison. I'm just trying to give you an idea of how to do the session thing.
Hope this helps you understand what's going on.
