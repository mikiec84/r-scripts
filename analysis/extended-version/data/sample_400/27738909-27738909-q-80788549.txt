I am writing an application with 5 tabbed view. but I am stuck with how to insert login page. I have read through a lot of threads, but I don't think any of them solves my problem. Here is the issue

1.  The first view is visible for both login users and guests. (Default view when user launch application)
2.  When guests try to view other four tabs, they are prompted to a login page (view)
3.  If guest cancel logging in, guest will come back to first view. If guest login, they will go to whatever view he clicked before.
    I have been thinking about this, it looks like I "insert" an view between tabbed view switching; and This view is "smart" enough to know whether should proceed to the view user wants (loggin case) or come back to where user started ( cancel cases). Any thoughts on this?
    Best,
    Bin
