I have a string with some HTML code in, for example:
I need to strip out the attribute from every HTML tag, but I have zero experience with regular expressions, so I searched here and there from the internet and I wrote this pattern:
Unfortunately it's not working as I would expect. Infact, I was hoping that the regular expression would catch the followed by any character repeated for any number of times and terminated with the nearest double quote; Practicaly in this example I was expecting to catch and .
But instead the pattern returned me the substring , it finds the first occurrence of and the last occurrence of a double quote character.
Could you tell me what it's wrong in my pattern and how to fix it, please?
Thank you very much
