How can one implement an array of function pointers in JavaScript within their XHTML document? Today we learned in lecture how to implement JavaScript functions in an XHTML document, but what about arrays of function pointers? Can I pop a bunch of functions in an array and dereference them by index as one does in C++? Just curious...
