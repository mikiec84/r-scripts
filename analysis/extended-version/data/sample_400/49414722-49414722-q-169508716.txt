I have this function in my user.rb Model :
def change_key
self.public_key = params[:public_key]
end
I want to call this function from a script on Views (new.html.erb) like this :
change_key(x);
and I want self.public_key to get the x value
The result I get is :
undefined local variable or method `params' for #User:0x00007f238cf8dd18
Any thoughts??
