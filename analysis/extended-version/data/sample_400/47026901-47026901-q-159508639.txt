Sorry for duplicate if my question is it: I found the solution for some hours and tried some solutions, but zero effect or lack of explanations.
So, how I can change the IDE GUI font family? NOT editor's code font family, NOT GUI font size, changing the the font FAMILY of GUI (menu, labels, etc.), please!!!
It's simply if you use Darcula Look and fill theme, but what if I use the Nimbus light theme?
