After considering the quote mentioned by @dyp, which is [expr]/6:

If a prvalue initially has the type “cv ,” where is a
cv-unqualified non-class, non-array type, the type of
the expression is adjusted to prior to any further analysis.
The conclusion is rather simple: The type of the initializer of the reference is simply adjusted to , which is clearly reference compatible to the target type of the reference (also ).
That allows the reference to bind directly. That is, there is no difference between these reference initializations:
In both cases the initializer is a prvalue of type .
