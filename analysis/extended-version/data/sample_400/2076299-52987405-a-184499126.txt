a bit late but this is what i found out...
will only work (IE is an exception) if the window that you are trying to was opened by a script using window.open() method.
you will get console error:
Scripts may not close windows that were not opened by script.
as an error and nothing else.
you could add a unique parameter in the URL to know if the page was opened from a script (like time) - but its just a hack and not a native functionality and will fail in some cases.
i couldn't find any way to know  if the page was opened from a open() or not,
and close will not throw and errors.
this will NOT print "test":
you can read in MDN more about the close() function
