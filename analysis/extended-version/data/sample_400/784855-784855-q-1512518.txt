I'm looking for a library or toolkit (so I don't have to write it) that will allow me to do common things like the following in Linux:

  - Get the uid for a username.
  - Get user / group membership information.
  - Get information about free space on disk drives.
  - Any other potentially useful API calls that are not normally available in Java because they break portability.
    Anyone out there have any ideas?
