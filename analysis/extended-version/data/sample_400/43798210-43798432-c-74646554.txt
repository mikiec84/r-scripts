@vsoftco Sorry, I still fail to see the point of allowing cv-qualification on class objects: If I read it correctly, a prvalue is a transient result of an operation with value semantics(!), where the prvalue is owned by the code that invokes the operation. Imho, it's not the business of the operation itself to restrict whether its caller is allowed to modify such a value. After all, it's the caller's business to eventually destroy the value, calling its destructor. That is a non-const operation by definition, and it must be allowed to avoid creation of undeletable temporaries.
