The quantifier in your regex is greedy (meaning it matches as much as it can). In order to match the minimum required you could use something like . The brackets indicate a character class. So it will match everything inside of the brackets. The carat at the beginning of your character class is a negation, meaning it will match everything except what is specified in the brackets.
An alternative would be to tell the quantifier to be lazy by changing it to which will match as little as it can.
