I wrote a function to test if a string consists only of letters, and it works well:
My next step was to include “Extended ASCII Codes”, I thought it was going to be really easy but that’s where I ran into trouble.  For example:
I thought that the decimal value for ‘ñ’ was going to be 164 as listed on the ASCII chart at  www.asciitable.com.
My goal is to restrict user input to only letters in ISO 8859-1 (latin 1). I’ve only worked with single byte characters and would like to avoid multi-byte characters if possible.
I am guessing that I can compare the unsigned int values above, i.e.: 4294967281, but it does not feel right to me and besides, I don’t know if that large integer is VC 8.0 representation of 'ñ' and changes from compiler to compiler.
Please advise
