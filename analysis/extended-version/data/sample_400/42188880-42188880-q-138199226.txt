I'm new to javascript and I have the following code:
It prints out a list of coordinates
The question is once it gets to 8,1 What would you use to get it to continue to
then
1,3
and so on until it reaches 3,4 (this could be variable) then it stops.
In an ideal world I would be able to get it to go up to a maximum of 8,12.
