You may use a BETWEEN statement if you prefer. The parenthesis are required if you use the greater than equals version here. I recommend them regardless to communicate your intent to people that view this code later.
It is more typical to capitalize the SQL commands and use lower case for your columns, but that is just a stylistic point. It will work either way.
