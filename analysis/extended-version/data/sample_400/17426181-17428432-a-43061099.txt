Are you trying to use JavaHL? If so, you'll also need the Subversion API libraries which aren't necessarily included in JavaHL.
Otherwise, you can use SVNKit which doesn't require the Subversion API libraries.
This can be selected via the Windows->Preferences dialog box. Go to Team->SVN and look under SVN interface section and select SVNKit.
