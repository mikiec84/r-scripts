is called a "nil-coalescing" operator.
Quite simply, it checks an optional variable to see if it has a value, and:

  - if it does, the value is unwrapped and used
  - if it does not, the value to the right of the operator is used instead.
    For example:
    In this case, the variable equals "bread" because the variable was never assigned a variable.
    If you did:
    Now equals "lettuce" because we gave a value. And because is an optional, the value is automatically unwrapped (meaning we can use its value directly).
