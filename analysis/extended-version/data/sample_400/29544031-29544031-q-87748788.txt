Struggling with this for a couple of days. Trying to create a space delimited list of $host $useraccount $crontab entries.
I've tried a couple of different ways. Each ending in a different level of disaster, The closest I've come is this, someone point out the obvious thing I'm missing.
It seems to be complaining about trying to execute the output of the tail as a command.
./crons.sh: line 11: (Several pages of cropped cron entries): File name too long
./crons.sh: line 11: : No such file or directory
./crons.sh: line 11: #
