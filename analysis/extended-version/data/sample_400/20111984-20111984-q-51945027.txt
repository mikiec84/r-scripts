Hello again fellow programmers
Table:
Customer
cust_nbr
cust_name
cust_street_address
Cust_City
Cust_Zip
Cust_industry_code
I am trying to select:  customer number, customer name, customer zip & customer industry code for all those customers who have industry code between 1000 and 2000 or more than 5000 and then sorting the output by industry code.
here is my attempt:

do you see any issues with it? Someone mentioned there is a minor issue but i can't spot it as it seems to be giving me what i need.
Thanking you kindly.
