I need to make my button check if the user has:

  - entered text into the position textbox
  - entered text into the name textbox
    if nothing has been entered then it displays an error message box and exits the procedure.
    also it needs to call my insertIntoArrayist() procedure and pass the values to it and insert the new value into the array list.
    and then call my populateActors() one.
    Here is what i have so far:
    Pretty sure at the moment it would add the name, but not into the correct position.. for example if i want to add a name "Bob Marley" into position "1" it needs to go into the top of the array.
    There may also be some other errors with the code, so please if you see any let me know! All tips are appreciated :)
