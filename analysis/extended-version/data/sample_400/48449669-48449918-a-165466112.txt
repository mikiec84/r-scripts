Simpliest approach would be this:
So, basically, you just take last byte (last 2 bits) of your power and checking whether entire number is zero. The answer can be encoded in total of 3 bits.
More general approach for large numbers (represented in BigEndian):
So, for BigInteger:
Doesn't really matter how big it is actually. All you need is just to know whether or not it is zero, and 2 last bits.
PS
Actually, Im very impressed that everyone downvoting me out of "oh chezzze, math here" asumption. It was painfull at begining, but now Im just more confident, casuse I ran some tests =)
