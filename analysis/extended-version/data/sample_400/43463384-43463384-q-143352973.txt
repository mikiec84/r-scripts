I am trying to implement cosine similarity to calculate Item-Item Similairity using Input Dataset which looks like this -
UserID, ProductID, Transactions
where UserID, ProductID are Long values and Transaction is Integer.
I am following this example in Spark -

In above example it expects a dense Vector as input , which gets converted to RowMatrix.
Could you please help me convert my input data set -
to a Matrix of form -
I am aware of the way that I can create a CooridnateMatrix something like this -
But, this one uses actual user and product id values in place of indices of Matrix, and fails as soon as the values extend beyond Integer.
I need a way that i can convert my data to an indiced matrix.
