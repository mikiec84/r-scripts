Here's the TXT record I had to create to get SenderID to pass:
But I had to get both SenderID and DKIM passing to get mail into Hotmail's inbox.  To get DKIM to pass I had to create a custom domain for our GAE app that matched the domain of the email's From address.  Then I had enable DKIM through that domain's Google Apps account.  Then it finally worked.
