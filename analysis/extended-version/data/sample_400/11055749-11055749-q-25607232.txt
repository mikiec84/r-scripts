I have a windows form where in I open new threads for server communication.
I need to write in the form (in a textbox) how the server has responded to the query.
At the moment I do the server communication as follows:
The serverAction as it is now, is a void method within the ServerClass class, but I can ofcourse make that return a value if needed. However Im leaning more to delegates, but im not quite sure how to call back from the other thread...
The ServerClass is a simple class using WCF as follows:
Any suggestions how I can get a value from the "serverAction()" method?
