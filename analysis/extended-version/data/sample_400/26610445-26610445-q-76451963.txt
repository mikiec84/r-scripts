i must sorry for my bad english at start.
Im trying to do some math in maple.
My function
i try to calculate
f(0.05) * f(0.06) < 0
but maple say:

cannot determine if this expression is true or false:
(0.6000000000e-1/e^0.64692635994760e-1-0.6064e-1)*(0.5e-1/e^0.64692635994760e-1-0.6064e-1)
< 0
can i do something to calculate it?
