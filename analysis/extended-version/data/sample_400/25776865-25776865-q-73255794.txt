Basically i have a eeview that has a bunch of objects in it and the treeview needs to bind the same properties.
here is the code im using and it doesnt seem to work
Basically when i get to the third level of treeview items i just get the Namespace+ObjectName.
Isnt the DataTemplate supposed to flow on and on ?
