I have a circle shape dynamic body that simulates a bouncing ball, I set the restitution to 2 and it just gets out of control to the point it does't stop from bouncing up and down. So I want to slow down the ball linear or angular velocity using Damping.
But when the linear velocity of the ball reaches 80 or above it just go super slow motion. Can someone please explain me how Damping works and how to use method properly, thanks.
