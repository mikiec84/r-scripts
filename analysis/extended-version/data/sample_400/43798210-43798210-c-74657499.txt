@JonasWielicki: Basically, GCC has no equivalent. Roughly speaking GCC turns on all warnings that existing when it was introduced, but not any new warning for fear that this would prevent people with 3rd party software using from upgrading GCC (a very valid concern, I should not, seeing as GCC is used to build many Linux distributions). Later on they added to cover the missing set of warnings, and it was stabilized for the same reasons, and therefore doesn't include warnings included afterwards...
