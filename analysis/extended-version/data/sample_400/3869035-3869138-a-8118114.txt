I am running this on Ubuntu linux with UTF-8 as locale.
Here is the additional info as requested:
I am calling this function with a fully allocated structure and passing in a hard coded "string" (not a L"string"). so I call the function with what is essentially setCString(*obj, "Hello!").
Length = 6
!C string Hello! converted to wchar string Hello!xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
(where x = random data)
Length failure!
for reference
printf("wcslen = %d\n",(int)wcslen(obj->string)); prints out as
wcslen = 11
