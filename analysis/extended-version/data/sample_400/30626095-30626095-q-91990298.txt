I am trying to develop a function that takes a matrix of input, out a contour plot as an output. There is a function in which fits to my purpose. But for a self-examination method, I would like to do this myself. Like I said, my purpose is self-examination, I will not use this in an app or something.
Here is the deal, I have tried to do this with color maps, but what I got is a graph that seems like an uncalibrated TV channel (Graph is like that because, my function is discrete. I need to make this discreet function continuous.
I found a solution to this problem. Solution uses linear interpolation method to connect each point with each other. Surface created this way will have lots of rough edges but that is not a problem. Connecting the points in the space to create surfaces is OK, but those surfaces also has point on them. Computing such a thing would be very expensive, since a lot of computations involved. For example, lets say, I would like to create a surface by using 20x20 matrix. Rows and columns will be the x and y coordinates, values in each row and column will be the z coordinate.
I need to connect at least 3 dots to make a surface. Those surfaces have also points in them. I want to design such an algorithm that reduces the computations. How do I do that?
