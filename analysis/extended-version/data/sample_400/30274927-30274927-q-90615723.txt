So, when i try to send a collection from server with duplicate entry (same id) backbone doesn't render that element.
But on model.fetch() if i return a model with  an already existing id,  it works.So now we have a collection with same ids.
Why is this different behaviour, i was thinking backbone will verify(check if that id alread exist) the incoming model before updating it  and not render it.
