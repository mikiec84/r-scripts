I'm trying to record sound using Android Emulator. I know that this question is popular over the internet, I checked many posts, it seems that only one person succeded: (it think he used

File fTmFile; insteadof String fTmpFile;
which i also tried). And following Philip's advice and the official site tutorial and also other resources, I'm still not able to record. My application throws exception at line:
more exactley, this is what I first get:
W/System.err(1042): java.io.FileNotFoundException: /mnt/sdcard/audiorecordtest.3gp (Permission denied)
which makes me think is something wrong with the storage location, because even I added 'SD Card Support' property for the emulator with size 256 MiB, I'm not able to acces it, furthermore I can see in the emulator the message: "Your phone does not have a SD Card inserted" when I go to Music.
I added both audio record and external storage permissions, in AndroidManifest.xml and both audio (record+playback) hardware settings to the emulator 2.3.3 on Win 7. Is anything wrong within my app, the way I storage the file or something else? Please, if anybody has any idea feel free to share, it will be appreciated.
