I think you must maintain separated the logical software configuration and the SVN structure. I would make the general structure like this:
Where "general structure" is:

The internal structure of projects and common code can be in any shape you want and the logical dependecy among projects and common codes must be defined outside the repository.
You can read more about the standard layout in the SVN Book
