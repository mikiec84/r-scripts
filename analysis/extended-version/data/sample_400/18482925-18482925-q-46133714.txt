I am currently working on a signup page and i was wondering if i could modify the url without the .php extension.
For example, it is now
www.xyz.com/signup.php
And what I would like achieve is
www.xyz.com/signup
Now I am assuming that I might have to use the htaccess file, but I am not sure about it.
Need some help people. Thanks in advance.
