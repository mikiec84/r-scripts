Try debugging the Test instead of just running it. This will case an exception beeing raised at the failing assertion.

The issue is that if you are in MyNamespace.Controller for example you automatically get the classes in MyNamespace, like Program. So the code will compile but I will have picked up the wrong class. The trouble I ran into is with EntityFramework configuration. I end up picking up the MyNamespace.Program class instead of MyNamespace.Domain.Program class on accident. The code compiles but then fails at run time. The cleanest way I figured to avoid this was to rename MyNamespace.Program to MyNamespace.ProgramLauncher.

What can happen is the entry class gets picked up if I just use in my code, and do not fully qualify it via . The part that troubles me is that this can result in the application compiling and then erroring at runtime.
I am interested in solutions that keep me from compiling an application that will exception at runtime. The best solution I've thought of is renaming the MyNamespace.Program entry class to something else.
Addendum:
This question's original title was ""Can I name the .NET Core Program class something else"". Unfortunately that resulted in multiple down votes, and some surprisingly opinionated responses to what I thought was a simple question. So instead of asking that question I've rewritten this question as a description of my specific problem, hoping it might be more helpful to anyone who stumbles upon it in the future.

What you want to do is draw your shape with an alpha mask applied to your paint. A mask will prevent some parts of the shape to be drawn on the canvas, like cutting a piece of paper and stick it on a wall before spreading the painting.
To apply an alpha mask to your paint, you first need to create a bitmap containing the ""hole"" shape (programmatically or by loading a custom image from resources), then create a from this bitmap with the proper Xfermode (depending if you want the transparent part in your mask bitmap to be cut out or the non-transparent part) and finally apply this shader to your paint before drawing the semitransparent rectangle or anything you want.
Be careful with performance: only create the Paint object once (do not allocate any object in onDraw() because this method gets called 60 times per second on the UI thread), and recreate the alpha mask bitmap only when the bounds of your View/Drawable change (if its dimensions depend on the View dimensions of course, otherwise you just create it once).

Be careful with performance: only create the Paint object once (do not allocate any object in onDraw() because this method gets called up to 60 times per second on the UI thread), and recreate the alpha mask bitmap only when the bounds of your View/Drawable change (if its dimensions depend on the View dimensions of course, otherwise you just create it once).
I'm sorry if I don't have time to give you ready-to-use code but I think you should find plenty of information about the technique I just described and you can start experimenting and figuring out the solution by yourself which is more rewarding I think ;)

The nil-coalescing operator (a ?? b) unwraps an optional a if it contains a value, or returns a default value b if a is nil. The expression a is always of an optional type. The expression b must match the type that is stored inside a.
The nil-coalescing operator is shorthand for the code below:

If we take a look at the code for the rpc module, we see that it wraps the underlying normal inter-node messaging features in disterl:

Cast works perfectly for this, but I am curious, what process executes the function passed by rpc:cast and call? Should I be worried about over/under concurrency?
Usually, when I want another process executing code, I use a pool of workers and send one of them an asynchronous cast with gen_server:cast/2 and let them handle it. But for RPC, it doesn't define what process does the computation. Are the processes pre-allocated and waiting? Or is every process spawned as rpc calls it and then terminated? From what I have read, this is incredibly inefficient if you are making many calls, as the processes are just being created and destroyed which isn't computationally easy.

I loaded tables with data around 250+ millions of records.
When I hit the queries with primary key columns in where clause, the results were very much satisfactory. When I parallelized queries in 5 threads, I could complete close to 1 million queries in 2.5 minutes.
However, when I tried queries with non-primary key columns in where clause, 1000 queries took almost 2 hours.
I knew that, not having primary key is big disadvantage, still we might have that kind of situation some where down the line.

1.  I tried to see if I can use secondary indexes, but they seems to be restricted to one column only.
2.  I could not find right example for custom indexes as it needs index type class.
3.  If I used all columns in the primary key, would that be helpful at least by 5%.?
4.  Is cassandra really a good solution if we expect more query situations without primary key columns in where clause?

Then you tell identity to use the above-mentioned to try to match either the old SHA hash or (for already updated users) the new-style hash.

EDIT
Considering my answer and the question, it is noteworthy that this answer was accepted likely due to the conclusion in the comments that PHP does not allow you to declare functions that throw exceptions like Java does. Simply put.
So this answer is to serve only that purpose. Can PHP declare a function that throws an exception? No, not by default. You have to try and catch the exceptions yourself within the function.

Why most leave it out when they can
The Javascript community seem to dislike unnecessary verbose code. It might even be said to be a sport to make the code as short and compact as possible.
Why this may not be the best practice for all
The habit of always using return may serve as a good reminder that a function always returns something and thereby remind you to reflect on whether the default behaviour should be overrided.
However an experienced programmer will have such considerations deeply internalized and therefore rarely have need for such reminders.
Conclusion
As one gains experience the sport for less verbose code intensifies and in that context writing code just confirming default behaviour is an absolute no-go.
So: in the long run I would say most people end up leaving it out and that it is justified to do so because of the high degree of internalization.

Including a return statement at the end of a void function for readability, should be fine. I honestly don't think doing so is going to add much to your footprint.
In my opinion, however, you shouldn't include a return statement at the end of a function that doesn't return anything.

But some people find it good practice. especially when you love being declarative and you know return statement is nothing more than actually a statement. (think of your programming being completly linear and you can only move between code with labels and goto statements). This way you always declare where you are going to: you are going back.
##Another reason to return void
For example you can have the following function
This way in a void method you can return 'early' to make sure you dont continue when a condition is not made. This is whats also called defensive programming.

But some people find it good practice. especially when you love being declarative and you know return statement is nothing more than actually a statement. (think of your programming being completly linear and you can only move between code with labels and goto statements). This way you always declare where you are going to: you are going back.
##Another reason to return void
For example you can have the following function
This way in a void method you can return 'early' to make sure you dont continue when a condition is not made. This is whats also called defensive programming.
note: most of the time your better of throwing an error instead. This way you realise earlier you forgot to match a pre-condition.

40140302,40140062,129689401,"Just for fun and FYI I wrote a little benchmark script to try it out.
To my surprise, the one with the return statement returned faster than the one without by about 100ms for about a dozen runs on Firefox (Gecko). This result was pretty consistent on both Mac and Ubuntu.
I also ran it on Chrome (WebKit) and the results were much more ambiguous, there wasn't much consistency at all.
These were my results and are in no way definitive. Feel free to try it for yourself. In my opinion your personal preference is more relevant than 100ms anyway. If that's how you roll, then add it.

You see I have 3 functions and all have not statement, and it's just fine.
Entering in opinion lands, I would say that you could leave it for your readability and comfort, but you would have an approach different from most of programmers. And as less is better (KISS), and if it's not necessary at all, it's better to omit it.

Unfortunately not. That way lies impredicativity and there is no good story for it in Haskell.

51053098,51053098,176403201,"TL;DR: I want to implement unification for row polymorphism, using a , but have gotten stuck.

Background

I’m writing a compiler for a language that has an effect system which uses row polymorphism, as in Extensible Records with Scoped Labels, to represent sets of effects attached to function types. That is, in this language, the kind of the function arrow is:
Where is an effect label such as or . A simple example is the type of :
In hypothetical Haskell syntax:
This means takes a of values of type , and a function from to with a set of effects , and returns a of s, also requiring the effects . A pure function is fully polymorphic in its effect, which is defaulted to an empty row; so is pure if its functional argument is pure; otherwise it requires the same effects as its argument.
I’m experimenting with representing the type system of this language within Haskell’s type system, so that I can lean on Haskell’s typechecker to write a verified typechecker in the manner of this blog post.
However, when I get to unifying function types, I need to unify the inputs and outputs by regular unification (equality), but I need to unify the effects by row unification, which is defined like so:
This says “if can be rewritten into under substitution , and and unify under substitution , then unifies with under substitution , plus a side condition marked with a dagger (†) that I’ll explain momentarily.
The (<U+2243>) relation means that two rows are isomorphic according to the following three rules:
In my current unverified typechecker, these two functions look like this in Haskell:
implements the rule described in the paper:

When a row is unified with some row , we first try to rewrite in the form […] If this succeeds, the unification proceeds by unifying…the tail of the rows.
So given , , and , along with the unification rule, is used to assert that can be rewritten into under some substitution, failing () or returning () the tail of the rewritten row, the substitution (because it’s always empty or a singleton), and the updated type environment. We don’t actually pass because we only need its last element .
The rule: a row which already begins with the given label is trivially rewritten by the identity substitution.
The rule: a row that contains a label somewhere within it can be rewritten to place that label at the head.
The rule: when unifying with a type variable, no label is present, so we can’t directly test for equality, and must return a fresh variable for the row tail.
† This enforces the side condition that prevents unifying rows with a common tail but distinct prefixes, thereby ensuring termination even though we’re adding fresh type variables.
In any other case, the rows are not isomorphic.

What I’ve Tried

I’m attempting to translate row unification with to the type level, using a type family operating on type-level lists of types: That seems to work for basic cases: But fails on more complex cases: I believe it’s because I may have implemented the rule incorrectly (the seems suspicious), and I’m missing the rule. I’m stuck on the implementation of because I don’t know how to bring a fresh type variable into scope (or whether that’s even the right approach). I tried this: But I wasn’t surprised to see that the free generates a type error:

Question

  - Is it possible to introduce a fresh variable with or something, or should I give up on trying to implement the typing rules directly and take a different approach?
  - Alternatively, is there some existing extensible-record library that specifically uses row unification (not some other method) so I can use the library or learn the technique from it?
    Note that this is not the same as simple set equality, because there may be duplicate labels, and they are “scoped” in the sense described in the paper I linked at the top of this question. This is important for two reasons: first, I intend to extend this in the future so that an effect label may have type parameters, e.g., ; and second, I intend to use this machinery to implement extensible records and variants in the language.

I’m stuck on the implementation of because I don’t know how to bring a fresh type variable into scope (or whether that’s even the right approach).

Question

  - Is it possible to introduce a fresh variable with or something, or should I give up on trying to implement the typing rules directly and take a different approach?
  - Alternatively, is there some existing extensible-record library that specifically uses row unification (not some other method) so I can use the library or learn the technique from it?

51053098,51053098,176426925,"TL;DR: I want to implement unification for row polymorphism, using a , but have gotten stuck.

Background

I’m writing a compiler for a language that has an effect system which uses row polymorphism, as in Extensible Records with Scoped Labels, to represent sets of effects attached to function types. That is, in this language, the kind of the function arrow is:
Where is a sequence of effect labels such as or —either a “cons” of a label with another effect row, an effect type variable, or the “pure” effect (an empty row). A simple example is the type of :
In hypothetical Haskell syntax:
This means takes a of values of type , and a function from to with a set of effects , and returns a of s, also requiring the effects . A pure function is fully polymorphic in its effect, which is defaulted to an empty row; so is pure if its functional argument is pure; otherwise it requires the same effects as its argument.
I’m experimenting with representing the type system of this language within Haskell’s type system, so that I can lean on Haskell’s typechecker to write a verified typechecker in the manner of this blog post.
However, when I get to unifying function types, I need to unify the inputs and outputs by regular unification (equality), but I need to unify the effects by row unification, which is defined like so:
This says “if can be rewritten into under substitution , and and unify under substitution , then unifies with under substitution , plus a side condition marked with a dagger (†) that I’ll explain momentarily.
The (<U+2243>) relation means that two rows are isomorphic according to the following three rules:
In my current unverified typechecker, these two functions look like this in Haskell:
implements the rule described in the paper:

When a row is unified with some row , we first try to rewrite in the form […] If this succeeds, the unification proceeds by unifying…the tail of the rows.
So given , , and , along with the unification rule, is used to assert that can be rewritten into under some substitution, failing () or returning () the tail of the rewritten row, the substitution (because it’s always empty or a singleton), and the updated type environment. We don’t actually pass because we only need its last element .
The rule: a row which already begins with the given label is trivially rewritten by the identity substitution.
The rule: a row that contains a label somewhere within it can be rewritten to place that label at the head.
The rule: when unifying with a type variable, no label is present, so we can’t directly test for equality, and must return a fresh variable for the row tail.
† This enforces the side condition that prevents unifying rows with a common tail but distinct prefixes, thereby ensuring termination even though we’re adding fresh type variables.
In any other case, the rows are not isomorphic.

Getting the shift positions out of your face will help a lot. Your code goes from to this This suggestion does assume that the bit-field definitions are used many times more than there are definitions of them.

I feel like there might be some way to use variadic macros for this, but I can't figure on anything that could easily be used as an expression. Consider, however, creating an array literal inside a function generating your constant:
If your compiler is good, it will see that the entire function is constant at compile-time, and inline the resultant value.

Thankfully there are macros that hide actual port IO operations (the left hand side), so it looks like a simple assignment. But all that syntax to me is messy.
Requirements are:

  - it only has to handle up to 8 bits,
  - the bit positions must be able to be passed in any order, and
  - should only require set bits to be passed.
    The syntax I'd like is:

    This compiles to 32 bytes on my particular architecure and takes 61-345 cycles to execute (depends on how many bits were passed).

Instead of thinking about how to get a background image inside of the triangle make your background image hang lower than you need it to and put two black triangles on the top of the row bellow the image. That way it provides the illusion that your background is hanging below, when in reality you are just hiding most of it.

You could have a (thread safe) session factory singleton that is responsible for ensuring only one environment is initialised and that environment is disposed appropriately by binding it to events on the ASP.NET AppDomain and/or similar.  You would need to bake this session model into your API so that all client first established a session before making any calls.  Apologies for the vagueness of this answer.

The good news: Your code works as expected.
Let's plot only the bars:
plot 1
Now only the lines:
plot 2
Now compare the scales of the y-axes. If you plot both together, the bars get plotted, but they are so small that you can't see them. You need to rescale:

17356432,17346886,43024687,"Nice question!
Several points should be made:

  - First, as I guess you already know (though some readers of the question and this answer may not), your schema document 1 is already legal as it sits.  So you don't need to modify the schema for schema documents in order to make it legal.  If I understand you correctly, however, you want it not just to be valid; you want the variant of it in which element declarations occur without xs:documentation elements, or without ds:added and ds:last_modified attributes, to be invalid.
  - Second, it is possible to modify the XSD schema for XSD schema documents in the way you describe, and it is in principle possible to validate your schema documents against the modified schema for schema documents.
    But schema validators are allowed to have built-in knowledge of some schema components in arbitrary namespaces, and they are required to have built-in knowledge of the XSD namespace.  So it is possible for conforming schema validators to see a request to validate schema document 1, say ""Aha, I already know all I need to know about namespace I don't need to read the schema document the user supplied"", and then not enforce the additional constraints you have specified.
    Concretely, in my tests, I was able to use Xerces J to validate schema documents against a modified schema for schema documents, but Saxon seemed to ignore the modifications and rule the schema documents valid even when element declarations lacked the required attributes.
  - Similarly, it is not possible, when validating documents against the schemas you write, to require your XSD validators to object to schema documents that don't meet your heightened requirements.
    With those background points out of the way, here is what you need to do.

1.  You do not need to import the ds schema into your schema document 1.  Importing it means that you can add references to the attributes ds:added, etc., to the types you declare in schema document 1 -- that is, it imports it into the schema being defined for the target namespace.  It has no effect on the schema used to validate schema documents (which is a schema for the namespace
2.  You need to create a schema that modifies the standard schema for schema documents, and not just by adding new components but by redefining or overriding components in the existing schema for schema documents.  There are two ways to do this:  using xs:redefine, and (in XSD 1.1) using xs:override.  In XSD 1.1, xs:redefine is deprecated, because its specification has proven to be incomplete and/or inconsistent, and interoperability across processors is poor for some ways of using it.
3.  You need to use an XSD validator to validate your schema documents against your modified schema for schema documents.  As noted above, this may not work with all validators.  If you have trouble making your XSD validator handle the case, you may want to consider writing a Schematron schema to enforce the few constraints you mention, and building Schematron validation into your work flow.  (One of the advantages of Schematron is that validating just a few isolated aspects of a document is quite easy.  That may be a drawback in some situations, but not in this one or in other cases where one wants a little incremental increase in validation.  And if as your user name suggests you are an XSLT users, Schematron is likely to feel quite natural to you.)
    As a test, I've used xs:override to modify the schema for schema documents for XSD 1.1; the schema document is shown below, and the comments will, I hope, make reasonably clear what is going on.  If you have access only to an XSD 1.0 processor, you will need to use xs:redefine instead; some details will change.

17356432,17346886,43028589,"Nice question!
Several points should be made:

  - First, as I guess you already know (though some readers of the question and this answer may not), your schema document 1 is already legal as it sits.  So you don't need to modify the schema for schema documents in order to make it legal.  If I understand you correctly, however, you want it not just to be valid; you want the variant of it in which element declarations occur without xs:documentation elements, or without ds:added and ds:last_modified attributes, to be invalid.
  - Second, it is possible to modify the XSD schema for XSD schema documents in the way you describe, and it is in principle possible to validate your schema documents against the modified schema for schema documents.
    But schema validators are allowed to have built-in knowledge of some schema components in arbitrary namespaces, and they are required to have built-in knowledge of the XSD namespace.  So it is possible for conforming schema validators to see a request to validate schema document 1, say ""Aha, I already know all I need to know about namespace I don't need to read the schema document the user supplied"", and then not enforce the additional constraints you have specified.
    Concretely, in my tests, I was able to use Xerces J to validate schema documents against a modified schema for schema documents, but Saxon seemed to ignore the modifications and rule the schema documents valid even when element declarations lacked the required attributes.
  - Similarly, it is not possible, when validating documents against the schemas you write, to require your XSD validators to object to schema documents that don't meet your heightened requirements.
    With those background points out of the way, here is what you need to do.

1.  You do not need to import the ds schema into your schema document 1.  Importing it means that you can add references to the attributes ds:added, etc., to the types you declare in schema document 1 -- that is, it imports it into the schema being defined for the target namespace.  It has no effect on the schema used to validate schema documents (which is a schema for the namespace
2.  You need to create a schema that modifies the standard schema for schema documents, and not just by adding new components but by redefining or overriding components in the existing schema for schema documents.  There are two ways to do this:  using xs:redefine, and (in XSD 1.1) using xs:override.  In XSD 1.1, xs:redefine is deprecated, because its specification has proven to be incomplete and/or inconsistent, and interoperability across processors is poor for some ways of using it.
3.  You need to use an XSD validator to validate your schema documents against your modified schema for schema documents.  As noted above, this may not work with all validators.

19063740,19063366,48301992,"Your question is funny because if you interact with the concept of streams you almost always get bytes instead of an string. You used the idiom of reading a file to a string:
But this actually is made to read a file line by line to a string.
You can actually use just the plain FileInputStream but this time with another idiom (or you use Apache Commons like described above):
You could just put the integer (value between 0 and 255 for one byte 2^8) into an byte array. Now the problem is you don't know how many bytes you receive from the stream (how big the file is) and therefore you can't determine the size of your resulting byte array. One solution is to use a list (like ArrayList) and afterwards convert it to an byte[] with the list.toArray(new byte[list.size()]) method but I don't like this so much.

The two likeliest reasons (not mutually exclusive) for something to go wrong with self.myWorker.eventInputStream are

  - You're trying to read from it after its source was closed
  - There's a thread contention issue with that source
    That this is crashing in an NSThread makes the second option probable. That you report this happening ""1 time in 100 or something like that"" makes the second option a virtual certainty.
    Just to be sure, put everything using self.myWorker.eventInputStream on the main thread. If crashes immediately disappear completely, as would be expected, then you need to figure out how to properly lock access to the stream so that whatever the contention issue is here disappears. Good luck!

Let me explain: when creating applications using a complex view hierarchy and navigation logic, it's a good idea to have certain views controlled by a dedicated view controller. These controllers can have their own subcontrollers, and so on. All standard stuff really.
So why is the parentViewController property readonly? It's used by UINavigationController and UITabBarController, and many other properties rely on it (for example the navigationController property).
I've seen many people telling us to create our own property for managing view controller hierarchies, but that's a little silly when Apple's own framework uses its own private ""you can't touch it"" hierarchy model.

If the property is readwrite it might not be set,might not be set correctly or might suddenly change all of which would orphan the controller. That is unacceptable in the API upon which the entire platform depends.
Why risk making the API more fragile just to handle a rare design case? It's easy enough to roll your own for the rare circumstance in which you want a flexible hierarchy.

After the user clicks like, I do an AJAX call and add a row to the DB and then add and remove the class.
This is all working okay, except after the class have changed to 'unlike-post' the button still reacts to a like-post class trigger.
So I have this:
Which carries out that action even after the button doesn't have a class of like-post. I have checked and the class is definitely getting removed / added correctly.
I want to carry out another action with the unlike-post class but can't until this is resolved.

I prefer instead of redirecting input as you did.  In theory it should be the same.  I did not spot anything specifically wrong and I did not really change anything -- just rearranged what you had.
The advantage of the technique is you can insert commands between the cat and the while.  In this case, I would not do the tail -n +29 because you are guessing the first 29 lines are junk but that might not be true.  Rather I would just do a cat of the file and then egrep out the lines that start with a hash .  Again, .... yes, the cat is redundant but who really cares.  It is more general and easier to add and delete things.
I don't have the packages installed and I would not depend upon them unless absolutely necessary.  You are increasing dependencies.  So I just used the local ""ls"" and ""tail"".  I also added an explicit but you don't need that.  It just simplified my testing.
Perhaps the ls is overflowing.  Try this one:

14378339,14378339,34595578,"To simplify the question, I will describe a simplified use case:
Let's say I have a top level Grid that contains 1 dynamic inner Grid and a ListBox that fits in certain cells of the top level Grid:

1.  The top level Grid structure (TopGrid.xaml) is relatively static with only dynamic size of the cell that will contain the inner Grid.
2.  The inner Grid structure is dynamic, there are many/unkown kind of contents, but each kind of content is static and can be represented by a separate XAML. So I will have InnerGrid_1.xaml, InnerGrid_2.xaml, InnerGrid_n.xaml, etc.
3.  At run time, depend on the ListBox selection, certain InnerGrid should be displayed.
    I'm thinking of two ways to do it:
4.  Run time text-edit the XAML in the code:
    In the code, use XmlDocument to edit the TopGrid.xaml to add the content of certain InnerGrid_x.xaml to create the final in-memory TopGrid.xaml. Then use XamlReader to read the final TopGrid.xaml into a Visual Tree, then add the tree to LayoutRoot to show it.
5.  Visual Tree manipulation (no text edit):
    In the code, use XamlReader to read the TopGrid.xaml into a top-visual-tree, read InnerGrid_x.xaml into a sub-visual-tree. Then use VisualTreeHelper to find the TopGrid element in top-visual-tree, find the InnerGrid element in the sub-visual-tree. Then add the sub-visual-tree to the top-visual tree. Then add the combined tree to LayoutRoot show it.
    I know the first way will work but need complex XML manipulation (or text editing) in the code. I desire the second way but not sure if it will work. Especially, I will probably change the size of the cell in the TopGrid to hold the dynamic InnerGrid.
    Anybody has done this and can shed some light? or any better solution?
    A side question: Seems the dynamically loaded XAML cannot specify event handler inside XAML (my test), I need set event handler dynamically after creating the tree. Is that true?

It looks like the reason is that glibc's malloc uses multiple malloc ""arenas"", and gives each new thread its own arena, no matter what you set to.
And if there's space in that arena, glibc will give it to your requests.
You can disable that with .

Details

I confirmed this by importing (glibc specific) and changing your code to show [](statistics:
This prints:
We can see how a new was added with many bytes.
In , we can see the creation of this arena:
So looks like glibc s some memory for the new arena, frees some part of it, and then s many bytes -- just as much as that arena shows up as in .
This suggests to me that [](saying
isn't quite true: It will still when it wants to create a new arena.
You can apparently avoid this using:

All of the keys in an enum map must come from a single enum type that is specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the map is created.

In order to do that, we first have to look into the implementation of EnumMap. In Java, an EnumMap is just an object with an array of the value objects. Let's assume this example:
You have your Enum-class Colors:
and a class that stores some colored fruits in an EnumMap:
What Java does now is creating a new EnumMap - object with the following array:
This is exactly what makes an EnumMap so efficient. It's really not more than just an object with an array of value objects and some field that stores the class (in our example that would be ). In order for this to work as intended there can only be one keyType class.

9604973,9604973,21873836,"I am somewhat new to SSIS.
I have to deliver a 'generic' SSIS package, that the client will make multiple copies of, deploy and schedule each copy for different source databases.  I have a single SSIS Configuration table in a separate common database.  I would like to use this single configuration table  for all connections.  However the challenge is with the configuration filter.  When client makes a copy of my package, it will have the same configuration filter just like others.  I would like to give an option to the client to change the configuration filter before deploying, because for this new copy, the source database can be different.  I do not find an option to control this.
Is there a way to change the configuration filter from outside the package (without editing the executable .dtsx file)?  Or is there a better approach that I can follow?  I do not prefer XML configuration files, the primary reason being my packages are deployed onto SQL server.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

957064,957038,1855654,"The break after your default case is just a matter of personal preference.
Putting a break after return almost seems contradictory to me. I'd remove the break, just to make the return statement really stand out.
"
957052,957038,1855636,"I don't personally put the breaks in, but it could help when someone else decides to move the return (-1) to outside of the switch and forgets to add break.
"
957055,957038,1855642,"You don't need either break, but there's no harm in having them. In my opinion, keeping your code structured is worth having a couple of extraneous statements.
"
957071,957038,1855667,"Neither break does anything for you, but neither does harm.
Personally, I usually leave them out if I have a return - but I also try to avoid having multiple return points in a function if possible.
However, I do think the break in the case is good - for one reason:  If you were to leave it out, and somebody added a new case after default:, the behavior would be different if they ""forget"" to add in a break.
"
958668,957038,1858684,"Regarding the comment that others have made that they leave the break in the default case in case someone comes by later and adds a case after it: Where I work, the coding standard says to always put the default as the last case; so in our situation, a break on that case is just redundant. (This is one case where I agree wholeheartedly with the company's coding standard, because with the default case always being the last one, you always know where to find it, even in a long switch-statement.)
As for breaks after returns, I tend to omit the break unless there are any execution paths that do not return, as I find it redundant. (My exception to this is, on the rare occasions when there are several execution paths in a case and I can't tell with a quick scan of the code whether or not they all return, then I'll leave the break in just to be safe.)
"
957080,957038,1855678,"I would put the break in to show that you do not intend to fall through to next case.
"
957038,957038,1855610,"My OCD makes me add ""break"" when writing case statements, even if they will not be executed.  Consider the following code example:
My two questions are:
For ""case 2:"", I don't really need the break, but is it a good idea to have it there anyway?
For ""default:"".  Is it purely OCD, or is there any real reason to have the break here?
"
958451,957038,1858285,"I'm told that in C, C++, java and C#, if you don't put those ""breaks"" the program code flow will fall into the other ""cases"" and will execute the instructions inside them, not matter if the variable doesn't have the values assignned to the ""cases"".
"
957079,957038,1855677,"I agree with having a break in a final default case, and don't agree with breaks after returns.  (A colleague does those and it hurts my eyes.)
I also indent switches so as to reduce proliferation of indent levels. :)  i.e.:
(I also think that, since the return statement is not a function, it isn't appropriate to enforce a superfluous style that makes it look like one.)
"
957083,957038,1855682,"I would consider the break after return to be bad form, you will get warnings about unreachable code on some compilers.
The break on your default case is completely appropriate, case fall through is a tool and should be especially marked when used.

"
957359,957038,1856218,"As others have pointed out, placing a break after a return or in the default case is mostly a matter of personal style.
When I don't have to follow any specific style rules, I prefer something like this:
Between cases 1 and 2, I tend to prefer 2.  Even though the comment says NOTREACHED, comments can lie ( unintentionally of course ) when the code changes.  I like the NOTREACHED comment since it can satisfy lint that you know what you are doing and serves as a reminder that you exiting the function early.  The reasoning that placing a break after the return will mitigate errors if the return is deleted seem flawed to me.  You are still going to get bogus behavior regardless if you fall through to the next case or you exit the switch and continue on as before.
Of course, if I can avoid it I would not return from a function within the body of a switch.
"
957433,957038,1856372,"I prefer always have a break in each case including the default and avoid doing return at all inside switch's. For short switches with just 2-3 cases(including default) return is ok but only if all cases do it the same way. 'pointless' break i see as pointless and only make's it more code to read. Same goes for empty defaults that just do break, totally pointless. The ease to read the code is in my opinion more important that what happens if someone happens to change this or that.
"
958267,957038,1857937,"In this exact example, for both questions, it is personal preference. In general, the rule is this: anything without a break will fall through. That means (as Pod said) its a good idea to put breaks in default cases in case they are not last. This also means if your case contains a return, then a following break is indeed not necessary.

The viewmodel manages data and state - and nothing else. It is not supposed to contain any code that does HTML or DOM manipulation, at all.
In this case your data is a list of category objects. You want to inform the server when one of them becomes the selected category. Additionally you want to keep track of whether the viewmodel is busy talking with the server.
Therefore we need , and observables, as well as a subscription to changes in the selected category:
The view displays the category list, provides a way of changing the selected category, and reacts to whether the viewmodel is busy.
Therefore we need , , and bindings:
Note that you can use an observable as a click handler.

I load the space invaders into a 2d array like so:
My enemy class is:
They are drawn and moved in the ""draw"" (basically processing.js's version of ""update"") loop. Like so:
Then (where the problem most likely is) I handle movement like so:

I have thought of somehow creating a column object with its own independent X and Y axis and to contain the invaders in there.

There is a function in the TeachingDemos package which will allow you to change the range of a plot, but it also will just redraw the plot from scratch (and due to changes in R 3.0.0 it is not currently working, so if you wanted to use it you would need to go back to R 2.15 or before, or wait for it to be fixed).

17150082,17150082,42289945,"I have .net application that is compiled with 'AnyCPU' flag. This application uses MySQL for persistent storage.
I have run into a strange problem i.e. When I run my application on a 32 bit machine and hook it to 64 bit version of MySQL running on a different machine, my queries end up in state "" Waiting for table metadata lock "".
I have already tested that it works fine when both, my application and MySQL, are running on the same platform i.e. both on 32bit or both on 64bit.
Here is my theory which can be totally wrong :)
Since my application is loaded as 32 bit application, consequently the .net connector assembly (which I presume is compiled with 'anycpu') will  be loaded as 32 bit as well. My guess here is that something goes wrong when a 32bit .net connector communicates with 64bit MySQL.
Is my theory correct?
a) If no, please let me know, what would be the easiest way to find out whats going wrong?
b) if yes, what can I do about it. The reason being I can't force the .net framework to load mysql's .net connector assembly in 64bit mode for my 32bit application. Even if that was possible ( within the same process), how in the world am I going to know, before loading the connector, what type of MySQL will my application be connecting to ....?
P.S. My gut feeling is that its highly unlikely that this theory is correct as according to Google, no else has encountered this problem before.

How, if I had my own spreadsheet file or database application, would I go about writing the data to a file and preserve the layout, formatting, etc.? Are there any standards, or does it just depend on the creativity of the programmer?
"
74182,74116,105458,"You can open the file as binary, instead of text (how one does this depends somewhat on the platform), from there you can write the data directly out to disk.  The only real caveat to this is endianess, which can become an issue when moving the files from one architecture to another (x86 to PPC for instance).
Writing binary data to disk is really no harder than writing text, and really, your creativity is key for how you store the data.

BOOST::Serialization, or Google's Protocal Buffers are a good example of these.  The basic idea is that you have memory structures (classes and objects) that represent your data, and you want to write that data to a file in a way that can be used to reconstruct those structures again.
If you're hesitant to use a library, you can do it all manually, but realize that you can end up writing a lot of redundant code, or developing your own library.  See fopen, fread, fwrite and fclose for a starting point.

382786,74116,620320,"A typical binary file format for custom data is an ""indexed file format"" consisting of
Where the index contains records ""pointing"" to the data.
The index consists of records containing an offset and a size.  The offset tells you where in the file the data is stored and the size tells you the size of the data at that offset (i.e. the number of bytes to read).
Suppose you want to store 50 records in the file you would create 50 indices and 50 data structures.  The 50 index structures would be written to the file first, followed by the 50 data structures.
To read the file you would read in the 50 index structures, then from the data in the read-in index structures you could tell where to ""seek"" to read the data records.
Look up (fopen, fread, fwrite, fclose, ftell) for functions to read/write the data.

for a spreadsheet application you could even use a text format (OOXML, OpenDocument) to store presentation and content information.
Or you could define binary datastructures and write that directly to the file.
the choice between text or binary format depends on the application. for a configuration file you may prefer a text file which can be modified outside your app, for a database you will most likely choose a binary format for performance reasons.
"
74134,74116,105379,"You basically have to come up with your own file format and write binary data.
You can also serialize your object model and write the output to a file, but that's usually less efficient.

21843835,21843334,58280381,"One error I can see in your code is that you're incrementing your counter more often than you should. You start with it managed by your loop, which means that it will be incremented (or decremented, for the leftward moving version) at the end of each pass through the loop. However, you also increment it an additional time in two of your statements. That means that might increase by two or three on a single pass through the loop, which is probably not what you intend.
Furthermore, the count doesn't necessarily have anything obvious to do with the number of moves you make. The loop code will always increase it by one, even if you're repeatedly trying to move through an impassible wall.
I don't really understand what your algorithm is supposed to be, so I don't have any detailed advice for how to fix your code.
One suggestion I have though is that you probably don't ever want to be calling methods on your class without paying attention to their return values. You have a bunch of places where you call but ignore the return value, which doesn't make any sense. Similarly, you should always be checking the return values from your calls, to see if the move was successful or not. Otherwise you may just blunder around a bunch, without your code having any clue where you are in the maze.

One of the major processing problems is that numeric data is separated with a comma, and a comma can also be a ""thousand"" separator in large numbers. I've tried to copy your data sample, but some rows come back as text with only numbers and commas, and other rows come back as very, very big numbers in exponential format.
So you may need to do some work on defining the incoming data type. This may be an issue with regional settings. My regional settings have the comma as the thousand delimiter.
You may be better off posting an actual Excel file with a file sharing service and post a link here.
Power Query can do this -- that's a given. We just need to straighten out the data format to work out HOW to do it.

An Internet Calendar Subscription is a calendar that you download and view in Outlook. However, unlike a Calendar Snapshot, Internet Calendar Subscriptions are updated automatically.
I'm using ASP.NET MVC and the DDay.iCal library. I have been unsuccessful creating such a calendar. I need answers to specific questions. I'm tired of guessing. And I won't accept random code, links to out-of-date codeproject articles, or anything else non-authoritative.
The only concrete information I have is that the URL must

  - begin with
  - end with a filename
    I have to generate a unique and up-to-date calendar per user, preferably every time Outlook polls the address. I want to avoid hooking the calendar updates into the CRUD parts of the site. So, I need to know some specifics about what Outlook accepts.
  - Can I use a controller/action that returns a (or derivative: stream, content, path) to dynamically generate the calendar when Outlook hits the address?
  - Can I ""fake"" the ICS file/filename part of the URL by decorating the action, like ?
  - Can I use an to create the link for the action, like ?
    I've tried some of these things in an ad-hoc fashion and Outlook loves to pop up and handle links, but it shows nothing and displays no error messages. Is there somewhere to dig for Outlook web calendar import errors?
    If no to the above questions, is there another way to serve fresh contents every time Outlook polls the address? I'd rather not update the calender in sync with the CRUD operations on the site. That seems more complicated than is necessary.
    Either way, I also need to know what parts of the iCalendar specification Outlook requires to have a properly updating ""subscription"". I imported a valid ICS file as a regular ""snapshot"" with as little as a start/end date, summary, and location. But, apparently, there are some tricky parts of the spec, like
  - Do I have to set the (RFC2445 4.7.2 Method)? I can't even find a decent description of this property or the values it accepts (is it client specific?).
  - Do I have to keep track of event UIDs and change their disposition based on my system's CRUD operations? Or is adding/removing/updating the events from the calendar on subsequent polling good enough for Outlook to figure it out? If I have to keep track, now I have to add a whole layer of persistence and state-awareness to my application.
  - If I'm keeping track, I've noticed in other SO questions that Outlook is real picky about the property... does it have to be an email address or not? A link or just an address?
    I'm at the end of my rope. I'm willing to read documentation if it answers questions about actually building a website that generates proper calendar subscriptions. I haven't found anything on MSDN except this strange conversion ""algorithm"". And, as far as I can tell, it's useless.

In PHP, you call sha1($string).
I can't do anything about the .net side of the code, but how can I get the same hash out of PHP that .net will generate?

Technically, SHA1 is defined on bytes rather than strings, but (correct me if I'm wrong) PHP strings work with single-byte characters, so bytes and characters should be interchangable from the SHA1 algorithm's point of you.
You'll have to make sure that your string's value in binary is the same as .NET's byte array, in the same order. I'm not a PHP guy, so you'll have to get someone else's answer for how to do that.
"

Then, you would parse the result string back into bytes and compare with the .NET output.
Note that you could create this string in .NET with the same format rather easily (use the ""x2"" format on the call to ToString on each byte and append all together).

The last time I remember that JS developers had to really worry about genuine leaks was when Internet Explorer (6 and 7 I think) used separate memory management for the DOM and for JS. Because of this, it was possible to bind an event to a button, destroy the button, and still have the event handler stranded in memory -- forever (or until the browser crashed or was closed by the user). You couldn't trigger the handler or release it after the fact. It just sat on the stack, taking up room. So if you had a long-lived webapp or a webpage that created and destroyed a lot of DOM elements, you had to be super diligent to always unbind events before destroying them.
I've also run into a few annoying leaks in iOS but these were all bugs and were (eventually) patched by Apple.
That said, a good developer needs to keep resource management in mind when writing code. Consider these two constructors:
If you were to create a thousand instances of , the browser would have to allocate an extra gigabyte of memory for all those copies of the huge string. And every time you deleted an instance, you might get some onscreen jankiness when the GC eventually recovered that ram. On the other hand, if you made a thousand instances of , the huge string would be created once and reused by every instance. That is a huge performance boost.
But the advantage of is that the huge string is essentially private. No other code outside of the constructor would be able to access that string directly. Because of that, each instance of could mutate that string as much as it wanted and you'd never have to worry about causing problems for other instances.
On the other hand, the huge string in is out there for anyone to change. Other instances could change it, and any code that shares the same scope as could too.

This is what I did, if the linear velocity exceeded from what I need it sets the ball linear Damping to 20 if not always set it to 0.5f.

Before calling ObjectContext.SaveChages() (in the unitOfWork.Commit() method), newly added category is not reachable (via the same ObjectContext).

I know I can execute the same query over the Categories.Local, filter the result only to newly added entities (since Local contains all entities of the set that are currently being tracked) and combine it with result returned from the database. Don't you think it's terribly ugly? And I'm not even sure if I'm not missing something right now. All this is work of the ORM.

  - The ad account needs to be specifically added to the app, in app settings. In developer access an app can only have access to a maximum of 5 ad accounts.
  - Error messages in Facebook API are misleading more often than not. Fix anything marked in yellow or red anywhere in the portal, to be
    sure.
  - Do read about limits of every API before you use it, all API have different limits and your application design needs to take those into account.

I'm still confused about this, but I will now be using Amazon SES to send email.  It is really cheap and it seems that Amazon takes a lot more care than Google to help make sure that email gets delivered.

But I had to get both SenderID and DKIM passing to get mail into Hotmail's inbox.  To get DKIM to pass I had to create a custom domain for our GAE app that matched the domain of the email's From address.  Then I had enable DKIM through that domain's Google Apps account.  Then it finally worked.

Rendering all of the unicode format correctly what with composite characters and characters that affect other characters and ligatures is really hard, I understand that. We have fonts that seem to be designed for maximum Unicode symbol support(Symbola, Code2001, others) and specialized fonts for certain planes or character ranges(BabelStone Han, others).
I don't know much about the underlying technical details for fonts. Is there a maximum size? Is it a copyright problem? Is essentially redrawing all ~110,000 extant glyphs too hard? I understand style concerns, but why not fall back to a 'default' font that had glyphs for everything? They're on unicode.org, redrawing them all would be pretty hard work but then you'd have a guaranteed fallback font for everything. If you got rights to some pre-existing fonts you could just composite them and that should help a lot. Such a font would be a great help to humanity and I can't see a good technical reason why it doesn't exist or at least an open-source effort to create it, so I presume an invisible-to-me reason why it can't be done.

C's random number generator normally produces numbers from 0 to RAND_MAX. This adds one to the value produced by the random number generator, so it can't produce 0. Dividing by RAND_MAX+1 would give us results from 1/RAND_MAX to (RAND_MAX+1)/(RAND_MAX+1), so the latter is 1. Since we want to avoid that, we use (RAND_MAX+2), so we get 1.0/(RAND_MAX+2) through (RAND_MAX+1)/(RAND_MAX+2), which will be something slightly greater than 0.0 to something just a tad less than 1.0.

Step 1: float s=10, u=30, t=2, a; Here the variable s, u, t, a are declared as an floating point type and the variable s, u, t are initialized to 10, 30, 2.
Step 2: a = 2*(s-ut)/SQUARE(t); becomes,

=> a = 2 * (10 - 30 * 2) / 2 * 2;
=> a = 2 * (10 - 60) / 2 * 2;
=> a = 2 * (-50) / 2 * 2 ;
=> a = 2 * (-25) * 2 ;

3085547,3085505,6384107,"The 'r' denotes a 'raw' string, which makes life easier when trying to write regexes (you don't end up escaping the escape characters).
As far as the second question goes, it creates a named match group of 1 or more digits, and passes that value to the view as 'poll_id'.
The reason there isn't a $ on the admin string is that you want all urls that start with /admin to be passed to the admin app. $ is a special character that defines the end of a string. So if there were an $, then only the url /admin would be passed to the admin app, not /admin/foo or /admin/foo/bar.

Some stats on the table: It has 1.9 million rows, and each MERGE operation inserts, updates, or deletes more than 100 of them.  In my test case, only 1 is affected.
So how does this get to 1200 subtree cost?  The data access from the tables themselves seems to be quite efficient.  In fact, 87% of the cost of the MERGE seems to be from a Sort operation near the end of the chain:
MERGE (0%) <- Index Update (12%) <- Sort (87%) <- (...)
And that sort has 0 rows feeding into and out from it.  Why does it take 87% of the resources to sort 0 rows?

I'm using the same code from before, but the situation is a little different.
First of all, I'm trying this time to use Unit Testing so I've created a Cocoa Unit Test Bundle, and I got that working correctly, then I wanted to make a Unit Test for my sqlite database.
The first thing run with this test is [self checkAndCreateDatabase] which is as follows:
Then I attempt to open the database with the following line:
This fails everytime with error code 14 SQLITE_CANTOPEN, and databasePath is ""/Users/labuser/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/Documents/projectfusion.db3"".
What is odd is that when I go to that directory, Documents/ isn't there, so if I create that, then it doesn't fail, BUT projectfusion.db3 then has a size of 0kb; the tables aren't there.  That makes any sqlite3_prepare_v2() fail, because the tables aren't there.  If I manually copy the projectfusion.db3 file to that directory before running, then it works just fine.
Is it because I'm doing this inside the unit tests and the scripts don't have permission or something?  Or is it possibly because I'm working on a school computer at my university and can't write to that directory? (I tried logging in as admin and it didn't work either).

The way it's been done right now, is the drop down is a template which has a helper to generate the list of users.
The problem is that the helper is being called on each list item. Add to that the face that I have a slightly complex function that alters the data upon retrieval. The complex function is also being called on each list item.
What I want to do is have a single reactive data point which will act as a single point of reference for the drop downs in all the list items.

The name will be entered at the same line as the initial prompt. Here's my solution:
The print! macro doesn't actually output the prompt until I call flush. But flush needs error handling, so I need both to handle the Ok and the Err case. In case of Ok, there's nothing useful to do, so I just print! an empty string.
Isn't there a shorter way to handle this? Maybe the error handling can be skipped or simplified somehow, or the whole print!/flush approach is the wrong one. (Everything works fine, but I could write this shorter in C, after all...)

In most cases, you don't want to use to report errors. Either you should return the error from your function and let the caller deal with it, or you should use to abort that thread and potentially the process.
Instead of printing nothing (which is inefficient), you can just... do nothing:
Replacing the with a would be even better:

Where I need to input -J-Dramos.nb.ui.font=""MyFavoriteFont,14"" in
NetBeans options?
You would provide that information as an argument to NetBeans when it is started. For example, on my Windows 10 machine NetBeans 8.2 is started by this command:
C:\NetBeans82_151\bin\netbeans64.exe
To specify the details for the plugin just append that plugin data as an argument. In my case I installed the plugin, then restarted NetBeans using the plugin with the Papyrus font:
C:\NetBeans82_151\bin\netbeans64.exe -J-Dramos.nb.ui.font=""Papyrus,14""
Unfortunately that (very old) plugin did not work for me on NetBeans 8.2, but perhaps it will work in your environment with a different font family.
If the plugin does not work for you either then the only other approach I can suggest is to see how the Dracula theme manages to change the IDE font, then attempt to replicate that without changing the theme.
You can select IDE Log from NetBean's View menu to review startup issues, and problems with the plugin might be logged there.

To specify the details for the ""ramos"" plugin you referenced:

  - Locate and edit the text file netbeans.conf which will be under your NetBeans installation directory in the etc folder.
  - Locate the line containing the text netbeans_default_options and append the data for the plugin, save the file and then restart NetBeans. For example, this line (at the very end) specifies to the plugin that the Serif font should be used for the NetBeans IDE:
    netbeans_default_options=""-J-client -J-Xss2m -J-Xms32m -J-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true -J-Dapple.awt.graphics.UseQuartz=true -J-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true -J-Dsun.java2d.dpiaware=true -J-Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=true -J-Dramos.nb.ui.font=Serif,14""
    Here is a screen shot of the NetBeans IDE using that (really ugly!) Serif font:

JNA allows you to call directly into native functions using natural Java method invocation. The Java call looks just like it does in native code. Most calls require no special handling or configuration; no boilerplate or generated code is required.
The JNA library uses a small native library stub to dynamically invoke native code. The developer uses a Java interface to describe functions and structures in the target native library. This makes it quite easy to take advantage of native platform features without incurring the high overhead of configuring and building JNI code for multiple platforms.

You can find the history of OEM437 on Wikipedia, in various versions.
What was endorsed as a standard 8-bit encoding is ISO-8859-1, which later became the first 256 code points in Unicode. (It's one of a series of 8-bit encodings designed for use in different parts of the world; ISO-8859-1 is specified to the Americas and Western Europe.) So that's what you will find in most computers produced in this century in those regions, although more recently more and more operating systems are converting to full Unicode support.
The value you see for is the result of casting the ISO-8859-1 code from a (signed) (that is, -15) to an . Had you cast it to an , you would have seen -15.

25467496,25467356,72078698,"To start with, you're trying to reinvent . But you'll need to pass the ISO-8859-1 locale IIRC, by default that just checks ASCII.
The behavior you see is because is signed (because you didn't compile with , which is the smart thing to do when you use more than just ASCII - VC++ defaults to signed char).

25467553,25467356,72079013,"I thought that the decimal value for ‘ñ’ was going to be 164 as listed on the ASCII chart at www.asciitable.com.
Asciitable.com appears to give the code for the old IBM437 DOS character set (still used in the Windows command prompt), in which is indeed 164.  But that's just one of hundreds of “extended ASCII” variants.
The value 4294967281 = 0xFFFFFFF1 you got is a sign-extension of the (signed) value 0xF1, which is how is encoded in ISO-8859-1 and close variants like Windows-1252.

Here a little piece of code to help you to find out what chars could be a letter:

I thought that the decimal value for ‘ñ’ was going to be 164 as listed on the ASCII chart at  www.asciitable.com.
My goal is to restrict user input to only letters in ISO 8859-1 (latin 1). I’ve only worked with single byte characters and would like to avoid multi-byte characters if possible.
I am guessing that I can compare the unsigned int values above, i.e.: 4294967281, but it does not feel right to me and besides, I don’t know if that large integer is VC 8.0 representation of 'ñ' and changes from compiler to compiler.
Please advise
UPDATE - Per some suggestions made by Christophe, I ran the following code:
It does return Spanish_Spain.1252 but unfortunately, the loop iterations print the same data as the default C locale (using VC++ 8 / VS 2005).
Christophe shows different (desired) results as you can see in his screen shots below, but he uses a much newer version of VC++.

Each winning call prepends its move to the front of the return value and passes that back up the stack.  This would be something like
You do have a couple of things to fix.  Most of all, you have to block taking a step you've already taken.  Right now, when your search hits a dead end, it keeps repeating the final step and backtrack in an infinite recursion.
Second, you'll need to implement logic to abort other searches once you've found one solution.  Setting a finish doesn't help much; that's a local variable, and you need to communicate to the calling program that you've failed or succeeded.
Is that enough to move you to the next step?

Its also said that the application would turn off if the last user session timed out. I hope this article will guide you properly.
Look at what happens when the request gets to the runtime.

1.  When ASP.NET receives the first request for any resource in an
    application, a class named ApplicationManager creates an application
    domain. (Application domains provide isolation between applications
    for global variables, and allow each application to be unloaded
    separately.)
2.  Within an application domain, an instance of the class named Hosting
    Environment is created, which provides access to information about
    the application such as the name of the folder where the application
    is stored.
3.  After the application domain has been created and the Hosting
    Environment object instantiated, ASP.NET creates and initializes
    core objects such as HttpContext, HttpRequest, and HttpResponse.
4.  After all core application objects have been initialized, the
    application is started by creating an instance of the
    HttpApplication class.
5.  If the application has a Global.asax file, ASP.NET instead creates
    an instance of the Global.asax class that is derived from the
    HttpApplication class and uses the derived class to represent the
    application.

Per Zerkey's question in the comments below, I got a little curious and looked around for ways to see what was loading, as debugging it from my PC was still slow, but considerably faster (about 4-6 seconds).  In IIS on the server this is published to, I went to Worker Processes, selected the process and clicked current requests on the right.  This showed me that it gets hung up on a 3rd party mobile redirection service I am using called 51degrees.mobi.  It takes about 10 of those 12 seconds for that redirect.  My timeout for this service was set too low.  As I recall, this timeout was set this way because the user has the ability to toggle back and forth between mobile and desktop after the initial redirect if they choose.  Disabling the timeout fixed the issue except on initial load/redirect, which would be fine, but now once the user tries to toggle between mobile/default, it will always take them to the desktop site until they clear their browser cache.  I am using 51degrees.mobi because more traditional methods like using isMobileDevice weren't even working.  If anyone has any input on how I could get the desired behavior out of 51degrees.mobi, I'm all ears.  I will post this in a new question and link when I can.

I have noticed that JavaScript placed in a page div section is only loaded/executed ONCE EVER for the first page that is loaded in a JQM site and never again within the same session.

I don't put js code in the page div anymore and instead use the pageshow or pageinit events depending on what I am doing.

The only problem I have is when I go back to index.html (the first page loaded, page with id ).
It's strange because I see the code executed correctly: , but the panel is not shown.
Any hints?
UPDATE: Just to test, I've created a new entry page, so index.html is not anymore the first page loaded. In this way the panel in index.html works correctly. It was just to completely exclude some unexpected behaviors related to the page. So the problem is exactly that it's the first page loaded.

I have noticed that JavaScript placed in a page div section is only loaded/executed ONCE EVER for the first page that is loaded in a JQM site and never again within the same session.  However, any JavaScript code in the page div section for any other page EXCEPT the first one loaded will execute every time.
I don't put js code in the page div anymore and instead use the pageshow or pageinit events depending on what I am doing.

2169126,2169078,4381234,"You're right, the first way isn't a good approach.  Observers are my preferred way to go, for a couple reasons.
First, if you use TDD (test-driven development) you can shut off observers to more purely test the model without every creation firing off a mailer creation.  Then you can unit test the mailer and observer separately.
Second, the idea of separating callbacks creates cleaner code.  Callbacks aren't really part of your model, they are events.  Your model contains the functions and attributes necessary to run itself, and the callbacks (implemented with observers) are separate event handlers.
That said, I don't think your second option is ""bad"" or less professional.  Either way works as long as it's at the model level, instead of controllers or (even worse) views.

I've been reading blog after blog, where guys explain how to get this going, but after countless hours of removing, adding, changing, debugging, pulling-at-hair, copious amounts of coffee and no luck in getting this to work, I'm turning here for some professional insight.
As the title suggest, I'm trying to get angular to work within an MVC 5 with Razor views, but I'm experiencing some very weird behavior.
Firstly, angular does not kick in on page load. I have to refresh the landing page at least 5 - 10 times before it kicks in.
When it eventually works, Chrome goes into overburn, consuming nearly all of the available resources before crashing. Console in developer tools comes up with a message ""Warning: Trying to load angular multiple times"".
The error is very descriptive, so I assume that I'm loading the _layout.cshtml page twice, when the client-side routing eventually kicks in, but each Razor view contains the @{ Layout = null } call, as it has been explained on so many blogs.
I've tried everything I could possibly read up on, and I cannot get passed this issue.
Following, my code:
ASP.Net Razor View
1.) _Layout.cshtml
I assumed that, because the is used for the index page (Home), it is where the angular instantiate should occur. I've seen blogs where they skip the all together, but to keep it consistent, I want this to be my starting point. I have tried to not use Layout in Home/Index, and call all my scripts in there, but it does the exact same thing, couple of refreshes, and Warning.
2.) Home/Index.cshtml
has been commented out, because this causes to not even load my JS files, weird behaviour :/
3.) Gallery/Index.cshtml
This is just a page to test the route.
4.) Web.config
The rewrite rule is important to ensure that the routing is done appropriately. I am using HTMLMode for angular, so this step is vital.
5.) app.js
There really is nothing weird about this, it creates the angular app reference, attaches the routing to the module and form there I configure the routing behavior.
From what I've read and understand, it makes sense to call the controller/action block as you would do normally in ASP.Net MVC.
The default routing for MVC I did not touch, as it's irrelevant in this scope.
I'm at a loss as to why this behavior is occurring and don't know where to start investigating. I've read blogs on the refresh issue and have tried what has been stated, but in this scenario, I just cannot get it to work.

Guice ultimately uses either reflection to set the value of myField, or it may use an auto-generated setter. There is no happens-before relation so that reflection-write happens-before field-read or method-invocation happens-before field-read (unless locks, volatiles or other means are used which forms the happens-before relation).
Therefore, I would say that there is a (perhaps rather low) possibility of seeing null values.
EDIT: as per writing to final field after the constructor ends (via reflection) holds the same semantics as initializing the field in the constructor. So, make Guice-injected fields final, set them to null and it should work correctly. This is indeed a very dark JVM corner :-)
Moreover, as per Guice performs injections in exactly one thread which makes it thread-safe... Seems weird to me performance-wise, but apparently it works this way.

If is in a wider scope such as or , then the same instance (or a proxy to it) could be injected into multiple injection points in the same context. For example, If you have parallel browser requests from the same session accessing and is annotated , you could have multiple threads accessing the same instance in parallel.

Not much of a problem, but using field injection is just more convenient. Another option could be marking the field as volatile (or even using a lock on it...), but is that really necessary?
The JSR-299 spec does not seem to answer this question. I'm using CDI on implementations like Weld.

  - The object into which I'm injecting will be used by multiple threads (it's @ApplicationScoped, for instance). I want this.
  - I understand that if MyClass is immutable, safe publication is not a concern. But I don't necessarily inject only immutable objects.
  - MyClass itself is assumed to be thread safe; this is not my concern. The concern is strictly about unsafe publication, e.g. the possibility of threads seeing half-constructed instances of MyClass, due to the rules of the Java Memory Model.

Luggage Name: MyProduct Description: Luggage Keywords: Airport
Category: Luggage Name: MyProduct Description: Other Keywords: Abc
Category: Other
What it essentially does is create a Dictiory which uses the supplied categories as keys; so using will get you a list of products that are in that category.
You do have to fill it first, ofcourse. The comment describes where that happens. For each string in the categorylist, it searches the three supplied string in each available product. You could add other properties of Product to your liking.
At the bottem, it loops through all the products and displays their properties with the correct category.
Note: if more than one category appears in a product, it gets added to both. If no category is found, the product is skipped. .

The current version of Unicode, v8 as of this answer, contains 120737 assigned code points, or almost twice as many as fit in a modern font. In fact, Unicode hasn't fit in a modern OpenType font since 2001, with the release of Unicode 3.1, which upped the number of code points from  	49259 to 94205.
""So what about font collections?"" I hear you ask. Why not use multiple fonts and support all unicode that way? Well now, you've just described Adobe's Source Pro, and Google's Noto (which are the same font).
As for the ""how hard can it be"": a uniform style for all glyphs in Unicode, across 129 scripts, each with their own typesetting rules? Incredibly hard. You may think fonts are just files with pictures for letters, and someone types a letter, that picture shows up: that is not how fonts work, and isn't how fonts have worked since the mid 1990's.
Modern fonts are the typographic equivalent of a game ROM: sure, it's not much use without the hardware or software to run that ROM on, but all the things that actually matter are in the ROM. Similary, modern fonts contain all the information for typesetting. Not just pictures, they contain the metadata, the metrics, the positioning and substitutions rules for arbitrary sequences, with separate rulesets for each written script that OpenType supports, possible bitmap fallbacks for small-point rendering, hinting instructions on how to properly rasterize vector graphics that are inherently not aligned to any particular pixel grid, and more. A modern font is a ridiculously complex application that a font engine consults to figure out how to typeset sequences of code points, and making a (set of) Unicode-encompassing font(s) is a vast team effort.
So: ""Why isn't there a font that contains all Unicode glyphs?"", because that's been technically impossible since 2001. We can, and do, make font families that cover all of Unicode, but with 129 different scripts all with their own typesetting rules, it's a large team effort.

""So what about font collections?"" I hear you ask. Why not use multiple fonts and support all unicode that way? Well now, you've just described Adobe's Source Pro, and Google's Noto (which are the same font).
As for the ""how hard can it be"": a uniform style for all glyphs in Unicode, across 129 scripts, each with their own typesetting rules? Incredibly hard. You may think fonts are just files with pictures for letters, and someone types a letter, that picture shows up: that is not how fonts work, and isn't how fonts have worked since the mid 1990's. Modern fonts are the gaming equivalent of a game ROM. Sure, it's not much use without the hardware or software to run that ROM on, but all the things that actually matter are in the ROM. Similary, modern fonts contain all the information for typesetting. Not just pictures, they contain the metadata, the metrics, the positioning and substitutions rules for arbitrary sequences, with separate rulesets for each written script that OpenType supports, possible bitmap fallbacks for small-point rendering, hinting instructions on how to properly rasterize vector graphics that are inherently not aligned to any particular pixel grid, and more. A modern font is a ridiculously complex application that a font engine consults to figure out how to typeset sequences of code points, and making a (set of) Unicode-encompassing font(s) is a vast team effort.
So: ""Why isn't there a font that contains all Unicode glyphs?"", because that's been technically impossible since 2001. We can, and do, make font families that cover all of Unicode, but with 129 different scripts all with their own typesetting rules, it's a large team effort.
And as for this:

Such a font would be a great help to humanity and I can't see a good technical reason why it doesn't exist or at least an open-source effort to create it, so I presume an invisible-to-me reason why it can't be done.
Just because you didn't know about them, doesn't mean they don't exist, with millions of people who are familiar with them. They exist, they're even open source, go out and thank the people who made them =)
