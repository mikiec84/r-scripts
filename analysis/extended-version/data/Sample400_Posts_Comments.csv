The clipboard is not written in C#, it is written in C++ and is a part of windows.  The error is local to windows and there is no C# code in that object.  This is the code that of the object having the error.  I answer is the text above the code.  The solution is in replacing the .DLLs with the newer library."

957079,957038,767200,"Probably.  But seriously, is using two indent levels for a switch actually conveying any information?  It really isn't.  The switch is one control level, not two, and the cases are easily read as alternations of it."

958451,957038,767438,"Actually, in C#, you don't use breaks in a switch statement. If you want to fall through, you actually have to use a goto statement to go to the case you want to fall through to (e.g., goto case 2;). I was quite surprised when I learned this, given how similar the syntax is between C# and C/C++. I guess it makes sense, though, because it forces you to do something explicit in order to implement fall through. (And in fact, it makes ""fall through"" a lot more flexible, albeit with all of the caveats that go along with using goto's in other situations.)"

2916110,2916082,2968060,They're the exact opposite and work in the same way. `All` will stop as soon as it find a value that is not zero. So `All()` is the same as `!Any()` and `Any()` is the same at `!All()`. Reflector both if you want to see it by yourself.

4142730,4142730,4470115,"so you have 2 questions (1) how to create a function which takes a vector argument and manipulates it with Part[], and avoid errors arising when Part tries to deconstruct an undefined symbol, and (2) how to remember evaluations of the function so that they don't need to be recomputed.  Or have I misunderstood ?"
4142730,4142730,4472959,"That code I suggested earlier builds a function `f` where `f[a,b]` gives `True` if `a->b` is an edge in the graph indices that were passed to `g`. I think I misunderstood your question in those earlier comments."
4142730,4142730,4473109,"Actually, no it doesn't, it builds a function `f[x]` that gives `True` if `x[[a]]==x[[b]]` for any edge `a->b` in the graph. No coffee yet this morning!"
4142730,4142730,4473941,"Mark: I just need (1). Michael: actually it checks if x[a]==x[b] instead of x[[a]]==x[[b]], that's the problem"
4147293,4142730,4475151,"Yes, that works, but the ""lack of typical elegance"" is why I keep coming back to this question. Using Part and just ignoring the warnings also seems to work and also gives the most concise code. I wonder if I should just Off[Part] and stop worrying about the warnings"
4147293,4142730,4475241,"Instead of turning them off completely, you can wrap your builder code in `Quiet[..., Part::partd]` to suppress them at evaluation time but leave them on elsewhere."

4572746,4572724,5018453,I have decided to eliminate the redundant relationships so now I am left with something that looks a lot cleaner.  Thanks!
4572746,4572724,5021963,One last thing: Right now I'm linking `managers` and `tenants` with a `managers_tenants` table.  But since `managers` HABTM `leases` and `tenants` HABTM `leases` would it be better to allow cakephp to link `managers` and `tenants` together through the common `leases` model?  I suppose this also depends on my code..
4572746,4572724,5031218,"It does. But personally I would agree that these things should be done thru the `Lease` model. Really, the tricky part would be how to differential `Users` into `Managers` and `Tenants`."

4822974,4822732,5349578,"I don't see why that is any different from what I'm already doing.

4822974,4822732,5349709,"I looked in Finder under build/Debug-iphonesimulator/ProjectFusion, ""Show Package Contents"" on ProjectFusion and it was in there.  Is that what you mean?"

4822974,4822732,5349880,"No I hadn't, I didn't think I had to because it has the whole ProjectFusion as a Direct Dependency.  But I tried to add it by (on the database file) right click->Get info->Targets and checking UnitTests as another target for it.  I got the same errors."
4822974,4822732,5349931,what is the value of databasePathFromApp?
4822974,4822732,5350017,"When run from the UnitTests databasePathFromApp =  ""/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator4.2.sdk/Developer/usr/bin/projectfusion.db3""&#xA;&#xA;I just tried to do the exact same things from the project and it runs just fine it looks like, and databasePathFromApp there = ""/Users/labuser/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/4.2/Applications/C0783695-CB4D-4EA2-A1A9-DC7C8C797CEA/ProjectFusion.app/projectfusion.db3"""

5225588,5225588,5879503,Why should it be abstract without abstract methods?
5225588,5225588,5879534,They probably don't want it to be instantiated
5225588,5225588,5879537,What's the point in having a base class with no methods to be inherited anyway?
5225588,5225588,5879565,"Because that class only has some fields and a constructor/destructor, but the behaviour of the class should be implemented by a subclass. I know this is possible in Java, so I was wondering if c++ supports this too."
5225588,5225588,5879684,I have added my code to demonstrate what I'm trying to do.
5225588,5225588,5879820,Personally I would make StaticSprite and DynamicSprite have a Sprite not inherit from a Sprite.
5225588,5225588,5879991,So you would use composition instead of inheritance in this case? What are the advantages of that in this situation? Thanks
5225588,5225588,5880217,having a dynamic versus a static sprite could be done by declaration ... are these derived classes even needed?
5225609,5225588,5879532,"The problem is that the class has some members which should get deleted in the destructor, so making it abstract would cause memory leaks..."
5225609,5225588,5879556,"Since the base class destructor is virtual, destructor for your derived class destructor will be called when and where needed. There shouldn't be any problems."
5225609,5225588,5879562,"@Bv202 - you also provide an implementation of the destructor, so you can cleanup there."
5225609,5225588,5879563,@Bv202 You can still implement a pure virtual destructor to clean up the memory.
5225609,5225588,5879566,"Well, that may or may not be what the OP wants -- it does add overhead to the class and changes semantics."
5225609,5225588,5879595,"If it contains data management, it isn't very abstract, is it? Another option is to make the destructor protected. That forces you do derive from it, as it cannot be destroyed alone."
5225616,5225588,5879540,"Ultimately, the question is ""why bother""?"
5225616,5225588,5879803,"@Randolpho - the question changed. Do you mean why have an abstract class, or why make it abstract if it has no methods?"
5225616,5225588,5881738,"Yeah, the question changed. I hate when that happens. :)"
5225632,5225588,5879567,You can't implement a pure virtual.
5225632,5225588,5879602,@Cthutu Actually you *can* implement pure virtual methods. It just means the child has to implement it again.
5225632,5225588,5879643,"And in the destructor case, you must."
5225632,5225588,5879652,"Yes you can, see e.g. 10.4/2: ""A pure&#xA;virtual function need be defined only if explicitly called with the qualified-id syntax (5.1)."" and 12.4/7: ""A destructor can be declared virtual (10.3) or pure virtual (10.4); if any objects of that class or any derived class are created in the program, the destructor shall be defined. If a class has a base class with a virtual destructor, its destructor (whether user- or implicitly- declared) is virtual."""
5225665,5225588,5879712,I have added the code in my first post. How should you solve it?
5225665,5225588,5879790,-1 because you can't possibly know if inheritance should be used or not.  Review Alexandrescu's visitor framework for an excellent counter-point to your statement.
5268589,5268589,5935194,Did you reboot after installation?
5268589,5268589,5935252,"Not right away, but then I installed the new Safari and rebooted. Trying again now."
5268589,5268589,5935318,"Just asking because, for example, the documentation says to reboot if you uninstall Xcode before installing a new one. Unsure if just renaming the old Xcode /Developer directory is possibly causing problems."
5268589,5268589,5936147,Shaggy Frog - reboot is required only if you've installed older version after uninstalling newer one.
5467862,5465550,11144614,"Actually you can pass in additional parameters to most of the ode routines that will be happily passed to the solution function after t and y. e.g. `ode15s(@computeRates, tspan, INIT_STATES, options, CONSTANTS);` would work fine, This behaviour is undocumented and may change in the future however. I should also mention that in this case the same arguments will also then be appended to the events function arguments etc. as well, which will not be the case with the anonymous function form."

5613031,5612997,6393721,"You could also have added the div **inside** the div for your images, that would ensure, that the div wrapping the images has the same height as the images (e.g. if you want to use a background-color)"

6859287,6859287,8157926,I suppose this is meant to use `A != null` in the condition (or the other operands swapped around).

6928544,6928544,8255691,"How does the first question you linked not answer your question? The code there works fine and does what you're asking. Your complaint seems to be that your `CategoryRepository.GetAll` doesn't use it. Well, fine, that's your code. Fix it."
6928544,6928544,8256050,For `DbContext` (EF 4.1) there is `Local`: `dbContext.Categories.Local.Contains(newCategory)` would behave as you expect.
6928544,6928544,8262771,And the `Local` from EF 4.1 actually just encapsulates query similar to first linked question.
7044982,7044982,8420314,"The first problem I see with your approach is that it will fail if the search string is a single word. BTW, how do you plan to get it without relying `q=`?"

7045058,7044982,8420423,"You can't, the `+` means a space (encoded), if the values don't contain any spaces, there will be no `+`!"
7045058,7044982,8420434,"as i see they are separators, thus you can get q and oq. From your post edit, i see that there may be other urls. so why not using OR operator in WHERE clause ? `WHERE ... REGEXP ... OR ... LIKE ...` Something like that."

8520999,8520999,10550514,what is die saying?
8520999,8520999,10550529,have you tried executing the failing query directly on the database? see what error message you get
8520999,8520999,10550718,"die isn't saying anything. the query works in the database directly, the problem is somehow with the variable."
8520999,8520999,10550756,"but it should work. And also in your example the $some_variable, is it declared?"
8520999,8520999,10550823,"I know it should work, that's why I'm here:) $some_variable is fine. Either way, when I write the statement to just update column1 with $in, it still doesn't work. I'm completely confused, I've been staring at this for 2 hours."
8520999,8520999,10550831,"If this is not working, die will die. So, what is not working?"
8520999,8520999,10550878,"Again, it works when I put $id instead of $in. In my example, $id is 11 and $in is 16. MySQL doesn't throw any error either way, it just inserts it in one case but not in the other."
8521158,8520999,10550784,"Yeah, I have ['in'] on the page, I mistyped it here. Writing the variables like that doesn't help, in fact it was like that originally and it didn't work. As I said, the statement works when I put $id instead of $in. When I print them out $id is, for example, 11 and $in is 16. What could be wrong?"
8521476,8520999,10551273,"First of all, I typed everything out, several times. $in types out as 16. $id types out as 11. If die(mysql_error()) doesn't show anything, why would trigger_error do any better? There is NO typo in the code. The only typo here was a forgotten '. The mysql statement is copy-pasted. My question here is simple: if $in is 16 and $id is 11, and both variables are created the same way, why would the same query possibly work with one but not the other? I'm not looking for basic syntax tips and I'm definitely not looking for someone to question my sanity."
8521476,8520999,10551544,I'm not looking for such a long comments. Just an output of the code I posted here is enough (assuming you'll assign the same number to the variables).
8521476,8520999,10551609,"bool(false) string(61) ""INSERT INTO tagovi_rel (column1, column2) values ('16', '81')"" string(61) ""INSERT INTO tagovi_rel (column1, column2) values ('11', '81')"" - that's what var_dump prints out"
8521476,8520999,10551665,The trigger_error(...) code doesn't print out anything. And mysql_query($sql) doesn't insert anything into the DB.
8521476,8520999,10551739,"With equal numbers, please."
8521476,8520999,10551817,"bool(true) string(61) ""INSERT INTO tagovi_rel (column1, column2) values ('16', '81')"" string(61) ""INSERT INTO tagovi_rel (column1, column2) values ('16', '81')"""
8521476,8520999,10551929,^^ in this case I had sample.php?id=16&in=16&lang=1 in the address.
8521476,8520999,10552095,"look, these queries are equal (`bool(true)` proves that). thus there is no difference, what variable to use. you have to look for another reason. Let me suggest a typo or some mistake of the sort, like if you are editing one file and running another one. Also try to run these queries with both numbers hardcoded . I doubt the number can be an issue but just to be sure."
8521476,8520999,10552248,"There is only one file. I've tried hardcoding numbers, it inserts them fine. The two queries are equal, but when I run both, sql2 works but sql1 doesn't. I know this doesn't make any sense, that's why I'm here looking for help. I've gone through every possible mistake and blunder I can think off, I've tried setting $in=16; instead of $in=$_GET['in'];, I've tried renaming it, saving it in a different variable, nothing works."
8521476,8520999,10552304,"In fact, now that I look at it, it doesn't accept anything EXCEPT for $id. Even when I set $trythis=16; and then put $trythis instead of $in, it won't work."

8724078,8724045,66762513,@EduardoBezerra you can see from the byte cide specification that imports are not used so they can have an effect at runtime.

8724125,8724045,11031399,"To be more precise, there is no performance impact at RUNTIME. However, depending on the number of imports, COMPILATION may be slower however unnoticeable."
8724125,8724045,24457544,"Why unnoticeable? Surely that depends on how many compilations you're doing? For example - we have a CI build server that is continually compiling multiple projects - therefore even the smallest optimization should increase compile performance slightly, right?"

9153579,9153360,19119148,Sorry for not being clear. Using your example I had the case where the `GetOrders` stored procedure required parameters to be passed with it. But because your setting this as a string I do not know how to do this.

9153615,9153360,11510843,Note that you cannot consume output parameters until you've read all the rows in the rowsets returned by the proc - kind of making the rowcount as output parameter in addition to rows basically pointless.
9153615,9153360,11511157,You can count the rows in the SP's query.
9153615,9153360,11511477,"And if you return a row set or sets and put the count in an output variable, you cannot get to the count output variable until AFTER consuming all the rows, making it often pointless.  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms971497.aspx#gazoutas_topic6  A workaround is to return the count in a first rowset and NOT as an output variable."

9153615,9153360,11521739,"I'm not trying to get into an argument here.  That's just one way of consuming the stored procedure output.  The point is that there is NO way to get the count first in an output parameter and then the rowsets.  Same thing in pure T-SQL - the rowset(s) will be spooled, then the variables will be set.  T-SQL has no way to consume multiple rowsets or assign a SP output set to a cursor, so it's more limited anyway."

9187180,9187046,11567616,well.. you can only serve a single document and that should include everything including the images. and that's why you can inline them.

If this happens, I believe other AppDomains in the same process (e.g. other ASP.NET applications) will keep running.  On the other hand, if an application pool (IIS6 and later) is recycled, the worker process will be shut down and restarted.

13874826,13864443,19109063,"So do I, but more out of a gut feeling than solid knowledge. And this approach forces you to provide an awkward ""dummy"" no-args constructor that simply nulls all the fields, right? Otherwise the class wouldn't be proxyable."
13874826,13864443,19110828,"You can annotated a constructor with `@Inject` and it will inject al of the args into the constructor, then you can proceed as you normally do. Of course any qualifiers will need to be on the constructor args."

But when I add a constructor with arguments (injection-annotated or not), I also need to add an explicit no-args constructor as well to keep the class proxyable.

14252332,14252212,19779273,I'm not looking at 3rd party services. I tried searching the apple site for any comment on limit. I'm looking for some official doc which either says its free or mentions the charges to reassure a client.

14260290,14190165,19864228,"Thanks - however, does this imply that ""general structure"" is all tied together? Or am I thinking about it incorrectly?  Very few of my projects are actually related to each other (in code terms), just the department they are for, although I do have shared ""library"" type code as well."
14260290,14190165,19868772,"Also, from a quick ""play"" with SVN, it appears that projects also have Trunk/Branch/Tag folders?  So do I have T/B/Tg inside my T/B/Tg ?"
14260290,14190165,19890149,"You can choose the layout. You can define a global T/B/Tg to branch and tag the whole repository having only one trunk where all projects progress or have the projects (and common code) and inside each one the T/B/Tg layout. It's your project/projects life cycle what defines the repository layout, without knowing more of your product development cycle I can't say more."
14260290,14190165,19890181,"Also maybe you must consider an approach based on several SVN repositories, one for each project."
14260290,14190165,19890346,"Thanks Diego :)  Last one (I promise!) as I am still a little confused.  There is no clear project life-cycle...it's ""as and when"" for most of them - When you ""Tag"" a Trunk - does that take everything from the trunk...as it is at THAT moment, or can you specify part of the Trunk?  e.g.  If I am working on Proj1 and ""diego"" has just started Proj2 - then when I Tag the trunk, do I get your part completed code?"
14260290,14190165,19891025,"I lied!  I am coming from VSS2005 - there you ""check out"" to a base folder...and everything else is relative to that folder.  Does SVN do the same?  I think that is the source of my confusion - matching where something ""sits"" in SVN to where it ""sits"" locally on my HDD!"
14260290,14190165,19891474,"You create a tag from any directory. That includes any directory of the trunk. A tag is only a copy. So you can tag trunk/Proj1 to tags/Proj1_release01, for example."

14634436,14634268,20443926,"Well, I wrote that I don't want to throw exception manually, like you wrote, because I supposed there was a better way to do that using natural internal exception mechanism. This would reduce amount of code. But if there is no chance to do that - well, then I'll check conditions and throw exceptions in method's code."
14634436,14634268,20444082,"I'll try to explain more carefully. I would like to write code here like in Java, just like that `public static function isAscii($string, $type, $length = -1) throws OutOfRangeException`. If something like that is possible, there is no need in writing extra conditions in my method's code. I don't know all the possibilities of PHP, that's why I asked this question. If that's not possible – no problems, just wanted to ensure."
14634436,14634268,20447371,"I think ""better way"" may be a matter of perspective. As far as I know, php doesn't have a means for defining functions like Java, and that's ok seeing as they're just different languages. Succinctly, the answer would be ""no"" that you cannot do this and have to rely on the self definition. I'm not the end all authority on this, but in my 8+ years of PHP and numerous frameworks, CMS packages and adopted code I've never known of this being possible."

(As well as Subversive). One of the problems is that SVNKIt's [Open Source license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVNKit#Licensing) is a bit wanky, and Subclipse might not have given you the choice over JavaHL. See [the SVNBook](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn-book.html#svn.developer.usingapi.otherlangs) about SVNKIt vs JavaHL."
17428432,17426181,25345448,@pandit - One more thing: You can use SVNKit with either Subclipse or Subversive. You don't have to use Subversive as your Eclipse SVN client if you rather use Subversive.
17428432,17426181,25345643,@pandit - I just looked at the Subversive webpage: _JavaHL and SVNKit EPL-incompatible SVN Connectors are marked as “exempt pre-req” and “works with” dependencies (correspondingly) and are distributed from polarion.com_. That might be the issue: Subversive might not have installed either plugin.

The reason you only see `Smak` is because when `greet(""Smak"")` is called, it generates the alert and then returns `undefined`. Since line 10 is actually `greet(""Smak"")();`, the second parentheses cause an error (because `undefined` is not a function) and the script stops. Change line 7 and all should be well."

18638192,18636522,27440321,"This is really fragile. (For example, when pasting.) It will also break when text is just added at the end."
18638192,18636522,27440388,I also thought of this but I have 3-20 textboxes per page.
18638192,18636522,27440426,Sorry . but I did not paste the code wrote it down here ... :) did not see where the cursor to the code section went wrong. thanks for the correction :)
18638192,18636522,27440476,have a common selection change for each element and keep a track of the last changed text box name or index ...
18638192,18636522,27440513,typecast the sender object as &#xA;&#xA;((TextBox)sender).Text use this rather than txtSel.text that I wrote
18638192,18636522,27441155,ok but I must update prevVal after I set the selectionStart and must use string variables for every textboxes I have
18638192,18636522,27445560,Yes prevVal must be updated constantly and better if you maintain a key value pair . Do some thing update the prevVal on focus first to store the current data then compare it in the textchanged and set the cursor. Theres no direct method to go through it so u will have to code it through. Forgive me if i spell or write wront m using a note currently
18638192,18636522,27462451,thanks updating preval on focus is a good idea
18638192,18636522,27467821,"@Anobik I got 1 problem left now. When I Type at the end, the if case crashes for prevVal gets ""Index and length must refer to a location within the string."" error"
18638192,18636522,27467855,Please proceed :)
18638192,18636522,27468107,I can use a counter. at got focus the counter sets to zero and increases everytime in the textChanged event and checks and do stuff when counter is even.
18638192,18636522,27468634,"Yes, But tell me one thing weather you would like to do it for a particular textbox that are even in position with respect to the parent child relation. ?"

19445636,19445636,28832372,`html('')` or `empty()` should work fine. My guess is that height is not equal to `100`. Can you put an example in a fiddle.

19445636,19445636,28832433,"`$('#scroller' ).innerHTML = '';` is wrong however... should be `$('#scroller' )[0].innerHTML = '';` but I agree, the script don't pass the `if` statement"

19445636,19445636,28832598,Remove the ? innerHTML` assignment as it will most certainly create a JS error (see comment from @Jari). And don't use alert - put a `console.log('in cleaning code')` and check if it is written to the console. After the `if` add `else console.log('scrollerDivHeight='+scrollerDivHeight);` so you see whats really happening.
19445636,19445636,28832702,@1ntello for what reason? it's a question related to jQuery.

19526373,19526373,28980321,"@TechieJoe the site does call out to 2 different dbs, but even pages that don't reach out to them are slow initially, and then things speed up after that inital load.

19599928,19599928,29092853,That entirely depends on what the rest of your class definition and the init method says...
19599928,19599928,29092859,"It is more logical to use attributes `ben.name` and `ben.age`. If you insist on using indexing, you should implement [`__getitem__`](http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names) on the class."

19599988,19599928,29093013,"cool, so __getitem__ creates a list?"
19599988,19599928,29093083,no `__getitem__` is called when you access it with square brackets ... `__init__` creates a list
19675899,19674606,29236639,"Thank you, this makes sense. However, I think I left out some important info, sorry. The reason I had been trying to divide it into subsets is because the data isn't already divided into seasons. Right now TMAX, TMIN and PRCP are all associated with a single date like 19990701, which would be the first day of s1999. I don't just want to replace the dates because though summer and winter are 2-3 months and continuous, fall's calculations include the winter of that year (has to do with the organism I'm working with)."
19675899,19674606,29236701,"I've named variables that refer to the correct ranges but I can't find a way to group them all together under a heading like season. I just used s1997<-will.data[will.data$DATE>=19970701 & will.data$DATE<=19970831,]. Though I also tried making them subsets and replacing the dates using ifelse, though that wouldn't allow me to just put in the name of the season b/c the object wasn't defined. Thanks for the help and I'm sorry for leaving that out."
19675899,19674606,29239697,Why don't you store each subset as the element of a list and use `lapply` over that whole list?
19748769,19748769,29346230,Consider comparing the value to `9999` and `100000`.

19748925,19748769,29346699,This regex will match if your string contains any alphabetic characters: `.*[a-zA-Z]+.*`.
19748925,19748769,29346719,What was wrong with the code above? &#xA;I also want it to be a mixture of numbers of letters and still be able to recognize.

I am pretty sure this what you wanted. However, one may assume that you have made a mistake, that you instead wanted something like `CUST_INDUSTRY_CODE > 1000 and CUST_INDUSTRY_CODE < 2000`. In fact, your next condition uses `CUST_INDUSTRY_CODE>5000`, which makes me think: what if you actually wanted < for the first one???"

20806388,20804133,31384157,"First of all, sorry for the late reply. I think your version with a callback function that may or may not be passed is the way to go, I would have suggested something along those lines. A totally different route to go would be to use an [event based system](http://stackoverflow.com/q/1092531/1599111) (or implement a simple one yourself). `Servo.set_angle()` could then fire an `AngleChangedEvent` (with a `limb` argument), and `HexLimbs` could subscribe to these events."
20849332,20849332,31275150,What color spaces are you using for the various colors?
20849332,20849332,31275407,"I'm not doing anything specific to color spaces. I assume whatever iOS uses as a default space is what is being used throughout. I've added my code for `blankOutImageView` which is what creates the context I use. I've not dealt with color spaces on iOS so far. I was thinking maybe that's what I was running into, but I'm not sure where to set a color space."
20849332,20849332,31275501,"Ah, I was thinking of `NSColor`, not `UIColor`. I don't think `UIColor`s use color spaces. It could also be that the conversion to and from HSB isn't reversible. Perhaps one has a wider gamut than the other?"
20849332,20849332,31275623,The RGB colors don't match either. Perhaps I have an error in my color querying method. I'll update the question in a minute with more detail and some output.
20849332,20849332,31275900,"Aha. It was the order of the channels. Perhaps for an acceptable answer, if I could get something to add to `getColorFromContextAtPosition:` to tell what order to read the channels in. How can I tell whether the context uses RGB or BGR, etc?"

21176266,21176131,87328097,"@HassanBaig I think its because `hover` collides with `click` since phones can't `hover` like desktop users with a mouse cursor. So in a smartphone if you touch an image for example, the hover handler will trigger, but if you have a click handler it will trigger also. I think that was and is still the issue?"
21187565,21173910,31900840,"But where did the app get created?  Directly under `Default Web Site` or inside the `beta` folder?  I know where it ends up physically, I'm concerned with what it looks like in IIS Manager."
21187565,21173910,31901561,"For me, the new web application was created under the Default Web Site.  There is no beta folder in this instance.  Just separate where the files are located for your ""MySite"" and your new Web Application."
21187565,21173910,31902116,"Unfortunately, that's the issue I'm trying to resolve.  I don't want the web application to be located at the root of the site, I want it to appear in the folder."
21187565,21173910,31903641,That was completely unclear from the OP.  Let me tinker with this and find a resolution.

21240221,21240221,32007183,"Thanks Ian, that was concise yet to the point. Long story short: there is no shorthand without the slashes."
21240221,21240221,83663830,"@IanRoberts Moreover, one could stress that the '/' in /descendant-or-self::node() is referring to the very root node of the DOM; so the implementation starts looking at each and every node in the tree. This might be hard to grasp for a beginner."
21243434,21243434,32001455,"Well, if you haven't tried/searched anything it'll be harder.. What you want to do is [REPLACE](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/string-functions.html) some characters before searching"

21243491,21243434,32001671,"What he's saying is that you need to format the data in the database, then removing special characters from the search query becomes easy. So use preg_replace on the data when inserting, and preg_replace on the keywords when searching. This way you don't deal with special characters at all, you just remove them from the equation entirely."
21380207,21380207,32243531,What is `console.log(data)`? An array? A string?
21380207,21380207,32243552,just in case you've not... have you tried: JSON.stringify(jsonObj) ?

25467356,25467356,39742601,Better to work in Unicode.
25467356,25467356,39742686,First cast to `unsigned char` then cast to `unsigned int`. Then you should see the value you would expect.

27738909,27738909,43890151,"I thought about this, but it won't work because if I cancel login, I will not go back to my first view."
27738909,27738909,43893035,sure you can. You have to remember. We are in control of the app. You can programmatically switch tab bars. So put it in view did appear and have a button that performs the task to go back to tab #1 of they don't want to sign in like so MyAppDelegate *appDelegate = (MyAppDelegate*) [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];  [appDelegate SwitchToTab:index]

27739044,27738909,43890346,"Hi gabuh, I just tried your suggestion. I put this method in my first tab view. If user is not logged in, every time I click on the tab bar, log in page will come up, even I click on my first tab view. Since my first view is supposed to be visible for both logged in users and guest, I don't really want to ask guest to sign in when the click on the first item (first view) of tab bar."
27739044,27738909,43890457,"I also find that when I present my login page modally and dismiss the page later, it won't come back to my first view, it will continue to the next tab view."
27739044,27738909,43890985,"Inside that method you will know where you are, and where are you going, so you could decide if present or not the login if you are on your first view. And you could change the selected tab programatically, so you could go to the view you want."

27757576,27757220,43927570,Using `rollmean` is pretty slick. Could be used to populate the `findInterval` vector in my method and side-step the problems I had with `difftime`.

That is not new in C++11. It's just that, in your example, you'd have had to fiddle with `const_cast` or invoke a `mutable` member function to do it, because, you could only have bound the temporary to a `const` ref in the first place. However, if you consider a simple example like `std::cout << (std::stringstream() << 123).rdbuf();` then it becomes clearer."

27970833,27970737,44334848,There are generally no expressions of const non-class non-array type. `const` is not ignored on the return type. Check with class types.
27970833,27970737,44335402,See [this example](http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/1b539709420b33fc)
27970833,27970737,44343185,"*""There are generally no expressions of const non-class non-array type""* Sorry, I have to qualify that: there are no *prvalue* expressions of non-const, non-array type."
27971064,27970737,44334791,"Ah, yes, true. I didn't get this from the other answers. This one definitely explains it the best."
27971064,27970737,44335269,And this is indeed one of the weirdest rules I've encountered in C++. I think I've learned it when trying to bind to an lvalue reference where the type is deduced: `auto& x = g();` doesn't work if `g` returns a const non-class type.
27971064,27970737,44335566,@dyp By now I feel like one could write a short book about rules of reference initialization. It gets more complicated each time I try to provide analyses. (Btw: Thanks for correcting me. :o))
27971064,27970737,44335574,"Probably, the reason is that prvalues of non-class non-array type are immutable - they're values, not objects. Even if we try to bind them to rvalue refs, they're not directly bound, but an object which is initialized with them. Methinks prvalues of non-class non-array types are treated as true *values*, not *objects*."
27971064,27970737,44335642,"Yes, the whole initialization topic is rather complicated. Recently, I've argued that *function lvalues* appear in ref init because there are no rvalues of function type. It sometimes seems like a gathering of obscure parts of the language."
27971064,27970737,44335666,@dyp So you're saying there is no fundamental difference between an integer literal and a constant expression prvalue of integral type? (Apart from the funny fact that the latter is not allowed as a null-initializer for pointers)
27971064,27970737,44335716,"(Because an integer literal is IMO the best example for pure ""valueness"" in C++.)"
27971064,27970737,44335786,"@dyp Well, the term ""value"" doesn't really apply to functions, so it's IMO nonsensical to talk about lvalues of function type. You can't put a function on the left-hand side of an assignment, IIRC"
27971064,27970737,44335802,"Hmm. They're different kinds of expressions, for example (grammatically). For class types and arrays, we need to be able to get pointers, so they cannot be values to the same degree that *the other types* can."
27971064,27970737,59810918,"@M.M Thanks, that was a typo. Fixed."
27973970,27973970,44340874,You probably need to .unbind() the `.like-post` class and bind the new `.unlike-post` and vise-versa. I bet the original class is still being used as a reference by the DOM.
27974024,27973970,44340878,I wasn't aware of the 'body' bug. Can you link to more info?
27974024,27973970,44340990,"@Octopus: Discovered it myself. Create a page with absolutely position children (results in a calculated body height of 0). Mouse click events stop bubbling to body. document on the other hand always gets the events, so is a better default (and only one step removed from body)"
27974024,27973970,44341096,Thanks for this excellent answer! Did not realise I wasn't quite using .on as I imagined it should be.
27974034,27973970,44341154,Never use `body` as the default for delegated events as it has a bug (if styling results in a calculated body height of 0 it will not respond to mouse events). Use `document` as the fallback *just in case*.

28280911,28280911,44941303,"@HansPassant Well, I do not have a generic type argument (let´s call it T), I do have a type-param (see in the code). Thus I do not know how to pass that param to the generic method by not using reflection (since as you said its quite slow)."
28281375,28280911,44917247,The question is more on how to build this dictionary (esp. the actions/funcs within it).
28281375,28280911,44918409,@HimBromBeere Any concrete problems? That should be documented many times on SO or other places. Create the expression tree corresponding to `(object obj) => GenericMethod<ConcreteType>((ConcreteType)obj)`. Write this in C# and use a decompiler to see what such a tree looks like.

28603427,28603218,45511982,"Yes this works, thank you! Now if I want to add another partial view to the same index view, can I just add another @model to the index page?"
28603427,28603218,45512055,"why define model in index, Op is not using model in index, `RenderAction()` is well suited in this case"
28603427,28603218,45512225,No you can't able to able to add more then one @model in a single page. instead of it you can use any other class in your car class. Example: !st create a class like bikeClass in name of bike and thencreate a object for bikeclass in carclass. Then in your index view you can able to call bikeClass like @Model.bike( which you can use to pass to another partial view).
28603427,28603218,45512314,"If you can't able to understand let me know, I will post some codes."
28603427,28603218,45512425,Some codes would be nice. Eventually I want to create a List partial view to also display on the index.
28603427,28603218,45512462,K. I will add another answer in few mins.
28603566,28603218,45512165,"This does not work for me, maybe because I don't know what ""Cares"" is? Is this a better solution when you want to add multiple partial views to one index?"

28604181,28603218,45513440,So would it be more orderly to make a new class with `public InsertCarViewModel Car` `public InsertCycleViewModel Cycle` etc instead of putting those inside the InsertCarViewModel
28604181,28603218,45513597,"Yes, Then only you can able to use the model in partial view as its own class"

All I can tell you is that when you have a modal window open, the style affecting your webpage appears in two different places: in the body tag ( <body class=""modal-open"" style=""padding-right: 17px;""> ), and in the lightbox modal html as well ( <div id=""lightbox"" class=""modal fade in"" tabindex=""-1"" role=""dialog"" aria-labelledby=""myLargeModalLabel"" aria-hidden=""false"" style=""display: block; padding-right: 17px;""> ). You'll need to look through your code to find the offending style."
28932093,28931927,46120951,"Well, I wasn't able to find it, so I applied display: initial; on the body, is that correct? @trevor - probably not, now it moves down instead of left //EDITED"
28932093,28931927,46121483,Don't apply display: initial. Do what I suggested in my edited answer above. Adding that style rule will fix your issue.

28956853,28956853,46167018,OK editing with example of how I want it to look.
28956853,28956853,46167031,"Not sure if it's for demo only, but you should  use `<style>`... even for a demo."
28956853,28956853,46167088,"Ok, can you please create an image?"
28956853,28956853,46167166,"I made the dimensions smaller so it's easier to see, just click ""Run code snippet."""

28957494,28956853,46200531,"I found another solution that used :before and :after tags which should effectively accomplish the same thing (more elegantly) but I don't have time to post that solution.

28989142,28989142,46226749,So what is the problem?
28989142,28989142,46226793,"It's not clear what problem you're having, although at first glance it doesn't look like the code would do what I suspect you want it to.  What happens when you run this?  What would you prefer?"
28989142,28989142,46237666,"Judging by the code you're showing, the `div` will always be visible, unless you have some CSS that you haven't shown that sets `display: none`. Even after adding `display: none`, your code seems to work fine: http://jsfiddle.net/vncj2uce/. Granted, I was not able to use `onload` as I couldn't modify the `body` tag in JSFiddle, but the effect should be the same."
28989142,28989142,46237810,Are you calling `createtitleid` when `onload` is fired?
28989142,28989142,46237865,That's an interesting way to write a for loop. `for (i = 1; i < 10;) { ...; i++}`

29248145,29248101,46701057,Amazing!. Thank you. That was the missing piece of the puzzle.
29248145,29248101,46701097,"I actually clicked the up-arrow. I am abit confused too. It says ""vote up requires 15 reputations"" and gives the -1 ?!? I have a new account but I would love to endorse you. Any ideas?"
29248145,29248101,46701125,"I downvoted you because you didn't provide any explanation for your changes. See how nice it is to get explanations for certain actions? You are also  potentially changing the behavior of the code: The function will now be executed by the browser when the script was loaded, it's not passed to and executed by `client.js` anymore."
29248145,29248101,46701175,I think you misunderstand the intention of the code. The function name is supposed to be passed to `client.js`. See https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/javascript/start/start-js
29248145,29248101,46701208,"Thanks, @FelixKling. I commented on my post. Now, on you're 'potentially-changing-the-code-behavior bit', I'd say it's a reasonable assumption to make that `myFunc` will not be defined in ""cllient.js"" -- since defined in preceding code, especially."
29248145,29248101,46701226,note the OP's satisfaction in comment #2.
29248145,29248101,46701233,I'm confused by the last statement. Functions defined in earlier scripts are always accessible by code loaded in later scripts.
29248145,29248101,46701252,"I'm pretty sure there is a reason that `client.js` expects the function name passed as argument to itself and not a callback set on the `script` element. For example, `client.js` may loads other scripts asynchronously, and the callback should be called after *those* scripts have been loaded. However, I don't know for sure, and while your solution may still work, the explanation of why the code doesn't work is incorrect."
29248145,29248101,46701402,"Actually, it looks like I'm right: `client.js?onload=myFunc` makes this call: `gapi.load(""client"", {callback: window[""myFunc""], ..})`. `gapi.load` is an asynchronous call and `window[""myFunc""]` seems to be called after that call was made. You are changing the code so that `myFunc` is called after `client.js` was loaded, which is a big difference."
29248145,29248101,46701521,"@FelixKling, That's actually the same example I am following to make and API call to Google analytic. I have `<script src=""https://apis.google.com/js/client.js?onload=handleClientLoad""></script>`&#xA;and my handleClientLoad contains : `function handleClientLoad() {&#xA;	&#xA;/**/	docuemnt.write(""loading"");&#xA;	&#xA;        gapi.client.setApiKey(apiKey);&#xA;        window.setTimeout(checkAuth,1);&#xA;      }`   The least I should see it ""loading"" on screen, right?"
29248145,29248101,46701617,"@Ojen: As I tried to show in my answer, browsers don't seem to allow to call `document.write` from callbacks that are invoked by asynchronously loaded scripts. What about that is not clear?"
29248145,29248101,46701666,"@FelixKling, It's crystal clear now. Thanks for the explanation. I didn't have your code snippet expanded."
29248145,29248101,48112601,"Looks like you win, my friend. Great answer. I'm still a bit irritated of the DV as my answer helped the OP, but I'll live. :) I like your answer better anyway, @FelixKling. Cheers"

32617753,32617753,53086524,"It is significantly different -- your question implies leaving the old server up and available after the migration.  This means you have not migrated -- if you are still accessing data on the old server it is active and in production.

32852914,32852775,53553256,"Because of the `i'm` the problem is not 'simple', but 'impossible to solve'. You need different markers for quoting (pairwise: 'y') or deletions (single: i'm)."

32866403,32863127,53577465,Thanks torazaburo. What worries me is that the last snippet in the article you've provided about the Meteor bug does indeed leak memory in V8.
32866403,32863127,83746111,"""Actually, I'd suggest you mainly stop worrying about memory leaks. They occur only in very specialized situations"". I strongly disagree with this statement. At least Detached DOMs are a frequent occurrence in SPAs and every developer must know about it."

33606300,33605379,55035865,但是 label1 和 label2 的内容长度不一样，所以不能设置一样。。
33606300,33605379,55068279,你要什么效果啊？“ Then how to make the width of each label show depending on its content with even more labels in a view?” 看不懂你在说什么
33606300,33605379,55141633,额，就是label的宽度由内容多少决定，同时最左边和最右边的label分别紧靠父视图的左边和右边。
33606300,33605379,55144025,删了 make.left.equalTo(_label1.mas_right).with.offset(2);

34732718,34732718,57214835,If you want your typeface to not look like an amateur effort then you need a specialist for each script. And Unicode has a *lot* of scripts.
34732718,34732718,57241911,"Style wasn't something I was concerned about. I was thinking ""well why not have a fallback font that had everything so you'd never see 'glyph not present' because that's not helpful"" and an ugly glyph beats no glyph. As pointed out in Mike's answer there are technical reasons why a font collection is required, and very good open-source font collection efforts."
34732718,34732718,62025225,"Weight limitations aside, style matching is why font families are preferred. Most CJK fonts have weird looking Latin letters to actively make the latter consistent. When they are not actively made to match you have oddities: ⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹⁺⁻⁼⁽⁾ⁿ is my pet peeve. Adobe Garamond Premier —Pricey— has Latin and Greek, but they did not intend it for chemists to use both simultaneous —""α-ketoglutarate"" looks weird in many fonts."
34732718,34732718,90756484,"I know this is older but I'm surprised by the ""Is redrawing 110K glyphs (with metrics and kerning and combining attributes and hinting) too hard?"" I used to do typography. A plain, unoriginal typeface with 255 straightforward latin-# oriented letters is at least a couple days of work; probably a couple weeks; couple months for truly good work. 110K is the equivalent of 400+ faces with _much_ harder metrics and such. 15,000 hours of work or drastically more; so at least 7 or so years. So, kinda hard."
34734338,34732718,57241708,So Adobe Blank/the other things at the link you provided are 'font families' because a single font can't be large enough? That would be the invisible-to-me reason I was talking about. Thanks for pointing me to them!
34734338,34732718,57242906,"Adobe Blank is an extreme specialty font, it does the opposite of a full Unicode implementation: it has a special CMAP that maps every single Unicode code point to the same, single, glyph (the ""blank""). Instead of implementing everything, it implements nothing, and represents that nothing with an empty picture. It's used in font debugging as fallback during testing: if you see Adobe Blank's ""blank"" (which has a width, so you can see it in your text), you know the font you're debugging is missing something."
34734338,34732718,57243724,What a strange font. Noto doesn't have complete coverage (they're missing linear A among other things) but it's already 500 MB so I can't really blame them.
34734338,34732718,57244879,"it's special purpose for when you're doing type design implementation, as well as proofing before sending something off for production (be that text, a webpage, whatever). Especially for the latter, seeing ""nothing"" rather than text styled with a different font that might be similar enough that you don't catch it on the first proofing is quite valuable."
34734338,34732718,65527215,I wonder why the OTF/TTF specifications aren't updated to support more than 65536 maximum glyphs. Clearly we've surpassed this limit a while ago and downloading a single font would be easier than trying to navigate a font family.
34734338,34732718,65531185,"Because they can't. A USHORT can only fit 65k numbers. Want more characters? Good news: use a font collection. Which the spec *has* been updated with (https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otff.htm => ""font collections"")"
34734338,34732718,69073053,"Doesn't make sense to me to introduce a whole new concept and complexity to all the software (in addition to fonts, every software must now understand the concept of a family from which to pick a correct font that has the glyph we're trying to draw) only because the datatype is too small to represent all glyphs. IMO they should just update the format to support UINT32."
34734338,34732718,69086762,"Then feel free to sign up for the OpenType discussion list and posit that statement, and then you will likely get a pretty well-reasoned response on why that isn't happening (most notably: it fixes something that isn't a problem because font engines can deal with font stacks just fine, while at the same time breaking compatibility for every device on the planet. Not just computers, but also the million or so models of printers currently in use across the world)"
34734338,34732718,83841417,"I downloaded Source Code Pro, and the zip contains many files in the, ""family,"" but the files are just variations on the weight (normal, bold, etc.). Based on the above, shouldn't there be separate files for different parts of unicode. I tried the font in Notepad++, and characters ∅ (the empty set) and ↦ (the maps-to arrow) don't appear. Where's the rest?"
34734338,34732718,83847518,"""Source Code Pro"" is not the ""Source Pro"" family, it is the subset specifically for, unsurprisingly, the needs of code editor users. Instead go to https://github.com/adobe-fonts and you will see five sets to cover serif (CJK and not-CJK), sans-serif (CJK and not-CJK), and a special monospaced programming font (that's the ""source code pro"" you downloaded)"

37376197,37371916,64566953,"Also you can call `close(gcf)` just after loading the file. But thanks for the extended answer, I found the option to disable figure creation very useful!"
37376197,37371916,64568301,@JorgeGT You *could* do that but that makes a lot of assumptions about your file (i.e. it only contains one figure) and also assumes that somehow `gcf` actually is pointing to that figure which isn't always a guarantee.
37376197,37371916,64590857,@Suever Oh of course! I meant for OP's example. That's why I really like your very general `DefaultFigureCreateFcn` solution!
37620457,37358412,62732058,Thanks! More info: the thread doesn't have a runloop - the nsstream in question is using the main thread's runloop. I found the error in more detail: CFHash is getting called with NULL by CFReadStreamRead. Am i not allowed to read an nsstream by multiple threads even if the nsstream is declared atomic?
37620457,37358412,62732400,Hmmmm. Reading on a different thread than the socket's runloop sure sounds to me like something that's likely to turn out problematic. Did you find some documentation somewhere that explicitly states it to be safe?
37620457,37358412,62732827,No. But i have been doing it for years. Im relatively sure that this problem is not directly caused by that

38904662,38904543,65168565,problem solved thanks
38956042,38956042,65266197,Which microcontroller? Is the code you're looking at even for the same micro you're thinking about? The only 'generic' aspect is that 0x40000000 - 0x5fffffff in the Cortex-M3 memory map is where peripherals go. Anything beyond that is part-specific.
38956042,38956042,65269810,"Yeah, it's the STM32F205. Of course I'm reading the same datasheet for the uC the code was written for.  I'm specifically asking about the GPIO region, which is why I stated that in my original question."
38956042,38956042,65272056,"Right, if that context were in the question to begin with, then I wouldn't have had to ask. With only ""Cortex-M3"" to go on, ""the GPIO region"" is meaningless, because CPU cores don't have GPIOs. Similarly, for all we know ""someone's code"" which we can't see and reason about could feasibly turn out to be, say, some random misidentified STM32F1 code off the internet (where that address range would be the DMA controller) and thus render the question invalid. A good question contains _all_ the relevant details."
38956042,38956042,65285003,"So now that you have all the details, do you have any useful advice?  What did knowing it's a STM32F205 tell you that you needed to know?"
38956042,38956042,65285236,I'm thinking it might be a piece of code ported from a different platform where these addresses are defined. Or the memory may actually contain something useful and just be undocumented. I've seen examples of both in various third-party code.
38956042,38956042,65298024,I added the code to the original question.
38959308,38956042,65279298,"If the implied context of the question is correct, though, it's not even peripheral registers being accessed, just some reserved address space which happens to (presumably) read as zero rather than faulting (unless possibly there might be some undocumented debug/integration test registers there). Either way, it sounds a lot more like plain buggy code than anything sneaky."
38959308,38956042,65285048,"So are you saying that reading an address that falls in the GPIO address range, just above the register range would/could result in a fault?"
38959308,38956042,65298032,I added the code to the original question.
38959308,38956042,65314023,It could. It depends on how it is implemented in the hardware. I'm going to edit the answer after looking over the code you added.
38959308,38956042,65314425,"Do you have the value for `R2` at the `LDRB` instruction and `R0` at the instruction in question? I'm getting `0x400200FC`, which would mean the `LDRB R2,[R2,#4]` would be accessing `0x40020100`, which I do agree is not a valid address to read. It then also accesses `0x400201FC` which is also not valid."

40140062,40140062,67550015,if it doesn't return anything then you don't need the return statement. it doesn't make anything faster by putting it there.
40140062,40140062,67550101,"In my opinion removing the `return` makes it more readable, since you don't need it at all."
40140062,40140062,67550341,"If you ran that code through a minifier, it would remove that `return;`. Therefore it is not an optimization of any kind. If you must keep it, do be sure to include the terminating semicolon because of automatic semicolon insertion rules. See [the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return) for more information."
40140262,40140062,67550541,we don't specify function return types in javaSCRIPT.
40140262,40140062,67550680,According to [MDM JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void)  it's correct to define return type of function.
40140262,40140062,67550816,"void is a js operator and has nothing to do with functions. in java for example void is a function modifier, not just an operator that can be put there if the dev feels like it. not the same thing."
40140262,40140062,67550912,"It isnt really used in front of a function, its more often used in links `<a href=""javascript:void(...);""`"
40140262,40140062,67550930,It can be used to force the function keyword to be treated as an expression instead of a declaration. So it's  operator.
40140302,40140062,67550627,"The results of your JSFiddle seem completely random. Sometimes the function with no return statement executes faster (according to your timing), and other times the function *with* the return statement runs faster. I don't think this information is accurate enough to form a solid conclusion."
40140302,40140062,67550744,"i agree brynden. benchmarking is generally not reliable with javascript since there are so many different interpreters and versions.. however, on my set up, FF on mac, the one with a return came back first every time."
40141263,40141263,67554234,"It really depends on how you insert your data into the table, but one idea might be to scrap your current ""hscore"", ""lscore"", ""tscore"" columns and use computed columns with functions to determine whatever you need. e.g. `CREATE TABLE tblGames (gID INT PRIMARY KEY, hScore AS dbo.fn_calculateHScore(gID), lScore AS dbo.fn_calculateLScore(gID), tScore AS dbo.fn_calculateTScore(gID));` and the functions would just return the total values of the quarter table for each respective requirement."
40141263,40141263,67554295,"That said, why do you need to store the score in the games table? You would probably be better off creating a view with said functions if you really require it and not storing the total score in a table. It depends on your needs I guess, but eh."
40141263,40141263,67554377,"I didn't think of that, Our professor just gave us the assignment and wanted to see how everyone went after it... I was thinking of creating separate foreign key constraints is that viable or a waste of time? I like where you are going with the view though! By foreign key constraints I mean create a variable that references hScore and lScore and make tScore have to = the sum of those two.."
40141263,40141263,67554593,"You could use some sort of check constraint. What I would do if I were creating these tables is create the player table that has basic information about a player (id, name, dob, whatever), create a game table that has basic information about a game (id, name, perhaps where, etc), then create an event table that records points in a game (with columns like gameid, quarter, playerid, points). I wouldn't bother storing the scores, I'd get that from a basic SUM query against the event table."
40141263,40141263,67554744,"If I couldn't alter the table structures/designs, I think I'd just use functions to calculate everything from the players table, now that I'm looking closer at it. Presumably you have a table somewhere to record who the home team and who the away team was... I'd just create functions that calculates the total scores from the players table alone. The quarter table would be filled with functions to calculate the quarter scores. The game table would just calculate the totals based on the player table alone."
40141263,40141263,67554908,"EDIT: Actually, your ""player"" table is already kind of like the event table i'm thinking of anyway (except there's no column in the sample data for recording what team they're on). So I'd just query against that or perhaps create a view/stored procedure to do that if I needed to."
40141263,40141263,67556306,"It is an event table it's actually called plays.. I've implemented all the tables already, I just posted the attributes that I need the constraints on. The total of homeTeam and awayTeam scores needs to add up to a total score, which actually isn't an attribute in any table.... so can I create a view and add an attribute to it?? And Everything you said I should have I do have as in player table have their team ID and in the game I have away team home team and then home score and away score in quarter table."
40141263,40141263,67556526,"The total for the home team would just be a sum of all the player scores in the player table, right? e.g. if I wanted to find the total scores for each player in a game, i'd do a sum of the points in the plays table grouped by game and playerid (and quarter if necessary). If I wanted to find the total for a game id just group by game and not playerid. I'd create whatever views/stored procedures/functions you want based on that."
40141263,40141263,67556634,"Awesome thanks man really appreciate it! That makes a lot of sense! we have barely went over functions in class, but I think that's what he wants us to kinda figure out! You've been a big help!"

40217169,40217169,67698295,"What is the ""right"" order? Do you want list first the older files? The bigger files? Anyway you should sort the result list. See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7199911/how-to-file-listfiles-in-alphabetical-order"
40217169,40217169,67698296,Get list of XML files from input directory and sort it. It would be natural order of string as filename is string. Then iterate over List and load each file using new File with combination directory and filename as path.
40217169,40217169,67698332,The order is numeric.For example zey_3_20161020-092152_JK6_NO.xml The second part after the first underscore is the sort part like the 3

40903939,40903939,69021046,That is exactly why you should have one assert per test.
40903939,40903939,69034190,"@HebeleHododo while i like the idea of that, when you do have a single branch of a function you're trying to test, and there's numerous things to check, if not doing multiple asserts is the alternative just copy and pasting the same test several times, once for each instance of an assert you'd want to do?  That seems like a big violation of DRY :D"
40903939,40903939,69035284,"@Kritner you could write a private method in your test class which returns the object you want to test. Thus, eliminating the need to copy-paste."
40903939,40903939,69124481,"@HebeleHododo Many Testframeworks, including MsTest and NUnit have way of providing functionality to execute before each test is run (NUnit calls this `SetUp` for example). You could simply create a seperate TestClass for those complex szenarios where you have to test many things and have the asserts seperated by tests."
40903939,40903939,85234880,Why not use Assert.AreEqual()? That Assert method will show the mismatch between expected and actual values in the output log.
40971189,40971189,69152793,I don't think that such concept exists in `OOP`. You could try playing around with `trait`s but afaik those are not type-hintable...
40971189,40971189,69155668,Why should it be inaccessible? `$testService` is still an object of class `TestService` irregardless of that class implementing some interface.
40971189,40971189,69157227,"Thanks, @JovanPerovic and yoshi.&#xA;&#xA;Well, in my constructor I'm waiting an object with ITestService contract. I should discard any methods that not exists in this contract.&#xA;&#xA;I worked with c# and castle windsor IoC framework and I could only use the methods defined in the interface. It make sense to me, but symfony component confuses me."
40971189,40971189,69160831,This is a PHP issue.  Just the way interfaces and objects were implemented.  Your IDE should at least prevent you from using non-interface methods.
40971189,40971189,69166557,"PHP resolves methods to call at runtime. You don't need explicit [downcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downcasting) of object classes such as in Java or C++. In fact, you don't need to specify type-hints at all: methods will work well. Type-hints are runtime checks, contracts for method signatures."

41178216,41178216,69557425,@EOF We reserved addresses greater than 0x100000000000l for storing our system data. malloc() via mmap() will destroy our data as it would take these addresses as well.
41178216,41178216,69557495,"@JimMa: If you need special address ranges for yourself, mmap them first."
41178216,41178216,69557875,not using mmap would mean only sbrk?
41178216,41178216,69558352,@Adalcar Yep. At least malloc() in multithread code block.
41178216,41178216,69558484,"@ZanLynx That might be a potential solution but we have to change our system design. And can we guarantee that malloc() will never use the addresses were mmapped but have not been read/written? AFAK, mmap won't allocate the real space until a read/write operation happens."
41178216,41178216,69563662,Can't you use mmap to request specific pages?
41178216,41178216,69571980,"@JimMa: `mmap()` with a `NULL` first argument will not replace an existing `mmap()`ed area. AFAIK, `malloc()` will use `mmap()` this way."
41178216,41178216,69582961,"@JimMa: I don't know what your system design is. Do the mmap with PROT_NONE flags at the very beginning of main. Later in your program if you are actually allocating virtual pages in that memory range, you just change your mmap calls to use MAP_FIXED and it will overwrite the old mmap setting for the new call. But if you are using that high range just as some kind of marker on pointers, just leave the high range mmap alone and it will block other users of it."
41178216,41178216,69583082,"@JimMa: The problem with trying to fix malloc to not mmap is that malloc is not the only thing using mmap. You might upgrade some other library in the future and it will mmap on its own, bypassing malloc, and return a pointer to you from the high range...then what do you do."
41178216,41178216,69585474,@JimMa: I have to apologize. I thought this would be straight-forward to do. So I wrote code to do it. But Linux won't allow me to fill in the biggest gap from 00007fff533b6000 to ffffffffff600000 because even though its an empty map it claims its out of memory trying to allocate 184 petabytes.
41178216,41178216,94107690,"Running your program through `strace`, I can see `mmap(NULL, 134217728, PROT_NONE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_NORESERVE, -1, 0) = 0x7f17a4b00000`, so it looks like glibc used `mmap` to serve that request despite your requesting that it shan't do that."
41178216,41178216,94107705,"I see the same happening when setting the `MALLOC_MMAP_MAX_=0` environment variable, which according to [`man mallopt`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mallopt.3.html) should also have the desired effect. Perhaps the man page is wrong and glibc doesn't actually respect these requests?"
41178216,41178216,94107797,"Also note that you're not checking the return values of `mallopt()` (it could fail), but I've added checks and they don't return errors in this case."

42268595,42268595,71693522,Are doing any JSON serialisation?
42268595,42268595,71693693,"@JacobKing Yes. The problem is, I can't find out where exactly this crashes. there is a lot of JSON serialisation in the app.."
42268595,42268595,71693879,did you tried with exception break point?
42268595,42268595,71694682,@himanth I can't seem to reproduce this bug. The log is taken from a 3rd party crash reporter (Testfairy)

43798210,43798210,74637155,One of those questions which could have been avoided if one built the code with all warnings enabled (``-Wall -Wextra`` on gcc).
43798210,43798210,74640358,"@JonasWielicki: this does not enable all warnings, for backward compatibility reasons, which is why Clang introduced `-Weverything` :)"
43798210,43798210,74651986,"@MatthieuM. Today I Learnt. To clarify, is there something equivalent to that with GCC, or does GCC not need it because in GCC -Wall -Wextra in fact turns on all warnings?"
43798210,43798210,74657499,"@JonasWielicki: Basically, GCC has no equivalent. Roughly speaking GCC `-Wall` turns on all warnings that existing when it was introduced, but not any new warning for fear that this would prevent people with 3rd party software using `-Wall -Werror` from upgrading GCC (a very valid concern, I should not, seeing as GCC is used to build many Linux distributions). Later on they added `-Wextra` to cover the missing set of warnings, and it was stabilized for the same reasons, and therefore doesn't include warnings included afterwards..."
43798210,43798210,74662371,"@MatthieuM. GCC *does* add to both `-Wall` and `-Wextra` from time to time; the actual policy for `-Wall` is something like ""almost certainly indicates a bug, and even if it doesn't, the code can easily be changed to squelch the warning"", and for `-Wextra` similarly but with lower estimated odds of indicating a bug.  You'll probably have noticed that clang's `-Weverything` includes warnings where there's no workaround if the code is correct as-is - that's what the GCC people want to avoid."
43798210,43798210,74681554,"@zwol: Clang `-Weverything` is [meant to be used as a blacklist](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14185534/147192). Clang otherwise manages warnings differently, most notably by enabling the nearly no false positive warnings by default (without any flag) and by having a consistent warning story regardless of optimization levels. I remember designing and implementing the [`-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DiagnosticsReference.html#wdelete-non-virtual-dtor) and the discussions about whether to activate by default or not (hint: it's only enabled by default for abstract classes)."
43798210,43798210,74681918,"@MatthieuM. If I hadn't quit working on GCC in 2005, I would probably have pushed for a more aggressive set of on-by-default warnings by now, and probably also for the adoption of a mode similar to `-Weverything` -- blacklist-style usage was infeasible in GCC as long as there were some warnings _only_ controlled by generic options like `-Wall` or `-pedantic`, but I think that's been fixed by now."
43798432,43798210,74637144,"Good find. I wonder what is the logic behind this, how `const A` return type makes sense, in the first place and if it makes sense, why not `const int`."
43798432,43798210,74637241,"@alfC because `const A` means that all members of `A` cannot be changed (even if you copy A), while there is no members even exist for int."
43798432,43798210,74637260,@alfC [Looks like](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6299967/what-are-the-use-cases-for-having-a-function-return-by-const-value-for-non-built) it's to stop people from doing weird things with temporary class objects.
43798432,43798210,74641473,"That leaves the question why C++ allows class prvalues to be cv-qualified. Imho, that makes just as little sense as allowing it for non-class prvalues."
43798432,43798210,74645269,"@cmaster It makes some sense, namely it won't allow you to call non-const member functions on the class prvalue. I don't have an example right now, but I guess one can come up with some scenario, see e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/q/8716330/3093378. Of course in C++11 one shouldn't do this, as it'll make move semantics stop working."
43798432,43798210,74646554,"@vsoftco Sorry, I still fail to see the point of allowing cv-qualification on class objects: If I read it correctly, a prvalue is a transient result of an operation with value semantics(!), where the prvalue is owned by the code that invokes the operation. Imho, it's not the business of the operation itself to restrict whether its caller is allowed to modify such a value. After all, it's the caller's business to eventually *destroy* the value, calling its destructor. That is a non-const operation by definition, and it must be allowed to avoid creation of undeletable temporaries."
43798432,43798210,74646807,"@cmaster Indeed, I'm not advocating at all. But I guess language designers wanted to make sure something like `getA().expensive_operation()` can be prohibited (assuming `expensive_operation` is non-`const`), or similarly for `getA() = B`. Of course now we have [value categories overloads](http://stackoverflow.com/q/21052377/3093378) `&` and `&&` to select which member functions can be invoked on lvalues/rvalues."

43935947,43935947,74903855,did you try using `tmpLine.split()`? Then access the index you want.
43935947,43935947,74904206,When you do `f.readline()` you're advancing the pointer in file to the next line for each line read - is that what you're wanting?
43936006,43935947,74904414,"I believe since you are using the no args version of split, it will strip the whitespace for you."
43936014,43935947,74904154,You're reading a line and then reading another line each loop... so you're discarding half the file here
43936014,43935947,74904250,"@JonClements yeah my bad, rectified."
43936014,43935947,74904896,Might as well make it: `with open('xyzFile) as f: zArray = [line.split(' ')[2] for line in f]`
43936014,43935947,74906083,@JonClements added that too.
43936014,43935947,74908466,"Turns out the xyz file has `\n` at end of each row, which is carried through when using the above. Accepted alternate answer as this strips out references to `\n`."

44942756,44942756,76861795,What part of “API calls from app admins or developers and on behalf of ad account admins or advertisers” is unclear?

44942756,44942756,76871994,"Well what it says in red color in your third screenshot in the adaccount settings is probably not just red because they wanted to add a splash of color, hm? _“This ad account is inactive. Please go to your ads manager to reactivate your account.”_"
44942756,44942756,76872435,"Thank you for pointing out, I did not bother with it because the facebookmarketingdevelopers sample went through and made the API call anyway. But what you are saying makes sense, that looks like the only thing out of place, let me try fixing it."

44951270,44949643,76878466,Thanks BoboDarph i just gave that link a look
44951270,44949643,76878602,Basically all I did was find a way to split a list into sublists based on a list item (which in your case is the empty element - '') and then increase a counter and print the sub-list for each non-empty sublist. And pop all the unneeded stuff from the list (which in your case is the 'Pool member IP' string).
44962393,44958919,76920631,Interesting. Why is it then that there are so many examples on the net of people using `setEnabled` on these `views`?
44962393,44958919,76927705,"I've corrected my previous answer. `ToggleButton` also should respond to the `setEnabled` calls: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/master/core/java/android/widget/ToggleButton.java#150&#xA;&#xA;Is the alpha for your `ToggleButton` not changing when it is disabled?&#xA;&#xA;I'm not particularly sure which examples you might be referring to, but my guess is that they may be taking advantage of `StateListDrawables`. These allow you to display a different drawable depending on the state of the view (our case being enabled/disabled)."
44962393,44958919,77016478,"Well, it turns out that `setEnabled()` actually does work on those `views`. I found out when I called `setOnTouchListener()` on the first of three `SeekBars` in a row and now every other `view` reacts to `setEnabled()`. So something about `setOnTouchListener()` is preventing `setEnabled()` from taking effect, but I can't find any info as to why. Have any idea?"
44962393,44958919,77019267,Turns out it's not `setOnTouchListener()` after all. I removed it and the `SeekBars` are still working but now the `Textviews` are not. That was all I changed so I really don't understand what is going on here.
44978124,44974478,76931789,"Without server side pagination, datatable with records greater than 1000 is incredibly slow though..."
44978124,44974478,76931899,There are different methods to decrease the response time like find in batch or making a view with the data and calculation you need to view. please see this article about database views in rails https://melsatar.blog/2017/05/27/database-views-for-rails-performance-optimization/

45179092,45118380,77376878,I'll try that. I forgot to mention that treespacing is something which only applies when physics are disabled for the network and stabilize() enables the physics. I havn't found a way to alter the options after I initialized them. Otherwise I would just disable physics after stablize() is done and then reduce the tree spacing.
45179092,45118380,77384048,"This actually helped me - thanks! You might want to change your answer a bit.

45821700,45821700,78601323,Why is this a problem? The two classes should have different namespaces. Renaming `Program` is pure evil - will you remember in one year that you renamed the class to something else? Will the support guy know this?
45821700,45821700,78601506,Flawless victory @john it worked.
45821700,45821700,78601946,"Evil huh and the downvotes!? It's been a while since I posted a question on Stackoverflow, but it seems the site has really gone down hill since then. Thanks to all who have offered positive contributions. To everyone else. Go troll somewhere else please."
45821700,45821700,78651236,I rewrote this question as a description of my problem instead of asking a question (with background) I thought would address said problem. I really don't understand the down votes and wish someone would have taken the time to explain them to me. This is my attempt to remedy the mistake I think others think that I made.
45822596,45821700,78605090,"Maybe you just **try the stuff out**, before claiming it's wrong. When put `using MyNamespace.Domain` inside the namespace rather than above it, `Program` will **always** refer to your domain model and not the `Program` as program entry"
45822596,45821700,78605318,"Also knowing how to use namespaces usings will help you avoid with future questions when your domain model is called `XmlDocument`, `Application` or some other common type name used by the framework, or a 3rd party library where you can't simply ""rename the type"" (though you can alias it with usings)"
45822596,45821700,78651354,"Doing what you describe doesn't address the fact that the program can still be compiled and then error at runtime. If you care to take a look, I've updated the question to clarify that I'm looking for a solution that keeps me from compiling an application that will fail at runtime due to C# picking up the wrong Program class under the circumstances described."
45822596,45821700,78653114,"Sooner or later you'll run into a different type name which collides with a domain model name. Also the answer is more an alternative for others -less aggressive- users who come across the problem rather then to the specific question of yours. But there are also other ways to solve it, i.e.change the namespace of the `Program` class, i.e.instead of having full qualified name of `MyCompany.Program` and `MyCompany.Domain.Program`, you could change the namespaces to `MyCompany.Web.Program` and the issue shouldn't happen either. It's a common convention to surfix ASP.NET Projects `.Web`or `WebApi`"

I'd suggest that your answer as it is now is a side note and doesn't address the original question or current problem description. On the otherhand, I appreciate your comment that moving Program out of MyCompany namespace to something like MyCompany.Bootstrap.Program is a worthwhile answer to avoiding this problem."

46436316,46433814,79857660,"So it is probably not a good idea to be sending tons of rpc communication because each time node1 receives an rpc from node2, it has to spawn off a whole new process, which I have read is intensive."
46436316,46433814,79857813,"You suggest an alternative, to get predefined information about the node and send it a gen_server:cast() -  Ideally though you would want to use a pool so that 1) no new processes are spawned(time concern) 2) if an influx of messages come, then concurrency is limited. How then would you know the process id, if to get a process id you have to first consult some form of grpoc_get_worker on node1 from node2? Is there any commonly accepted workaround to this or is it sort of a ""fix"" that everyone does differently?"
46436316,46433814,79871877,"@Ryan Actually, I have good news for you! Spawning processes in Erlang is *extremely lightweight* in time, memory and CPU. The network communication and latency involved in talking to another node is much more expensive than the job `rex` is doing. So even though there is only one `rex` on the other side you could probably spam it pretty hard with requests without too much worry -- the overhead of `rex`'s work is negligible. If you have significantly complex calculations where RPC is a good fit then the cost of the cast is the least of your overhead concerns."
46436316,46433814,79872008,"@Ryan As for ""an alternative"", you can spawn a process on another node directly, which is why `spawn/2` and `spawn/4` accept a `Node` argument (http://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#spawn-2). All of this is impossible to make good judgements on without knowing what the jobs are, what the load looks like, etc. Context of operation is everything. Whatever it is you're doing, writing some test cases to see how they react to your load should be pretty straightforward. You could come to [Erlang/OTP chat](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/75358/erlang-otp) to discuss it with us."
46436316,46433814,79899350,"Thanks so much. You can tell i had concerns about all these processes but it doesn't seem like it will be a big deal. I don't remember where I read that processes had a high overhead in erlang, but I'm happy now knowing that it's not a big concern. Thanks for your help!"
46442217,46433814,79842974,"They pas through `rex`, but `rex` spawns a separate worker to actually execute each job unless it is sent a `call_block` (which then `rex` executes own its own)."
46442217,46433814,79855454,"Yep, you are right. `rex` spawns a process which does real work. I edit the answer."
46442217,46433814,79872067,"Because spawning is so fast in Erlang, I think the big performance bottleneck surprise would be the difference people will encounter over disterl between sending large and small messages. If the arguments to the rpc call were huge in terms of bytes you could start getting strange behavior. Or if the connection was slow or high latency. RPC gets complex pretty quick, but I think the spawning part is the smallest of all overheads here (on the order of 8 microseconds or so, network latency is going to be *way* higher than this usually)."

48449796,48449669,83892596,You wanted the last digit of the number.
48449796,48449669,83892601,If i have a number that can't be store in a int or a long what i can do?
48449796,48449669,83892615,You can replace int power with BigInteger power

49414722,49414722,85831108,The way you described your problem doesn't make any sense. You defined function without any arguments yet you try to call it with one (`change_key(x)`). What is this `change_key` method?
49414722,49414722,85831173,Your method is in the model which has no access to `params` by default.  Also your method needs to be defined to take an argument if you intend to pass it one.
49414722,49414722,85831215,"the change_key method changes the public_key attribute of every User created. That is the question, how can I pass an argument to a function of Model?"
49414722,49414722,85831217,"Not to mention that if you call this kind of method in view, you're probably doing something wrong."
49414722,49414722,85831247,Take a look: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Method_Calls
49414826,49414722,85831328,"I get ""wrong number of arguments (given 0, expected 1)"" when I try this"
49414826,49414722,85831369,`x` needs to be defined before you pass it to a method. so first try `x = 'foo'` then call the method with x or just do `change_key('foo')`
49414895,49414722,85832204,I got a 'Users' table on my database ( I use devise). A user has some attributes and public_key is on of them (and is just a string). I produce a public key inside a script on new.html.erb and I want to save it on database for each user. What is the proper way to do this?
49414895,49414722,85832357,"There are multiple ways of doing this. You could do it either in the `new` or `create` actions of your `UsersController`. Or, you could do it in your `User` model using a `call_back` either during `initialize` or `save`. Any of these has pros and cons."
49414895,49414722,85832538,First of all thanks for your answers.So inside the new function of the controller I should change the attribute? How would I pass the variable which is on the script to the function of the controller?
49414895,49414722,85832619,"Welp. I don't know when the first time is that you need to access the `public_key`. My tendency would be to set the attribute in the `create` action, but you *could* do it in the `new` action. I also don't know what your script looks like, but the logic for creating the `public_key` probably belongs in the controller or in a service."

50526694,50523606,88069196,Hey Temani :) What is this syntax `position / 20px 20px` ? And why is it not working if doing it on `background-image`? You're always doing new things to me!
50526694,50523606,88069333,@TakitIsy it's a syntax for multiple background ;) .. for each one you specify the image [the gradient in this case with one color] and you specify the size and position at the same time. Then it's important to set everything as no-repeat or all of them will get repeated and it won't work
50526694,50523606,88069368,@TakitIsy background image allow you to set only the image [the gradient] so you cannot add position/size ... but here it's the shorthand version including image/size/position
50526694,50523606,88069561,"It's not possible to do something like ""#905c3f top left/20px 20px, […]"" in your `background`?"
50526694,50523606,88069620,"@TakitIsy no :) all the trick is there, a color is not an image so you cannot apply size/position ... a color can only be used as the final layer [background-color] ... but if you specify a linear-gradient with same color, you will have YOUR color that you can adjust easily ;) .. so what I did is exactly like this, but with a valid syntax"
50526694,50523606,88069872,@Temani Afif Thanks a lot for this solution
50526694,50523606,88070559,"@TemaniAfif I love your solution, the syntax is a lot easier than mine. You could remove the corners and add `background-blend-mode:multiply;` to fulfill all the needs of the OP (only one div, only 4 colors)."

50526694,50523606,88071034,@TakitIsy feel free to do it ;) but the main idea of my solution is to not use mix-blend-mode to avoid browser support issues. That's why I propsed a solution with only gradient that is more supported

51053098,51053098,89097688,"@Li-yaoXia: They’re not arbitrary permutations, but the intent is that you can pull an element to the head of a row *provided* it doesn’t cross an element with the same label. That’s meant to implement the “scoping” of labels: `{x=1, x=""foo""}` matches `{x:Int | {x:String | s}}` but not `{x:String | {x:Int | s}}` because `{x=1, x=""foo""}.x : Int`—it selects the *first* `x`; swapping would change the type. In the paper they say these unification rules implement these equality rules: `[eq-head]` = `(r ≅ s) ⇒ { l | r } ≅ { l | s }`, `[eq-swap]` = `l ≠ l′ ⇒ { l | { l′ | r } } ≅ { l′ | { l | r } }`."

All the examples I’ve seen are either strictly monomorphic type *checking* (like Lennart’s blog post that I linked in the question), or include *inference* but require the language to be embedded in Haskell (e.g., Oleg’s “Typed Tagless Final Interpreters”).

51283729,51283631,89544729,OP already said that he is using: `image.setImageResource(R.id.name_of_image)` so what is your answer adding to that?
51283729,51283631,89544794,He uses a jpg with an invalid name und uses `R.id`.
51283729,51283631,89544839,@RickTeuthof I edited my answer to get the resources name.
51283729,51283631,89544863,oh sorry - i missed he uses `R.id`
51283729,51283631,89544971,"I already have the name of the image i want to use stored in a variable, i want to be able to use a construction like `R.drawable.variablename` to show an image depending on the name stored in the variable"
51283729,51283631,89545004,@RickTeuthof use `Resources#getIdentifier` then - there are lots of examples on the web
51283729,51283631,89545056,I'll edit my post to show what i'm currently trying to do
51283729,51283631,89545105,@RickTeuthof I added the way you have to go. Maybe you didn't use the `getIdentifier` right.
51283729,51283631,89545210,Ah i had to edit one minor thing like you posted. Now it works! Thank you very much

51626499,51626499,90217780,Don't use `UIALertView` it's deprecated and you can refer here for `UIAlertController` with textfields https://stackoverflow.com/a/33000328/5622566

51626499,51626499,90218310,++ in shared answer you just need to add `textField.isSecureTextEntry = true` for your password and I have checked copy/paste is working there.
51626499,51626499,90218597,"@kamaldeepsinghbhatia hi, please, where exactly should be that line of code? (""textField.isSecureTextEntry = true"")?"
51627194,51626499,90219070,"thanks, but I am coding in Objective C"
51627194,51626499,90219188,@TimcoVanco check updated code
51627194,51626499,90219646,"I still dont know how to make it :(&#xA;&#xA;I copy code you sent me but it still doesnt work. Should I rename function on my ""showLoginAlertViewWithTitle"", right?"
51627194,51626499,90219710,"yes, you have to configure it according to your code. You need to add your actions (whatever you're doing with `ok` or `cancel`)."
51627194,51626499,90220050,"Thanks, but it still doesnt do anything. I renamed function, and I am calling it, but nothing appears. It cant be done easier? I just need to allow copy/paste for users, is it impossible to do that like with one command? :D"
51627194,51626499,90220293,See.. It isn't difficult may be your code is breaking somewhere. Here I have attached the output also.
51627194,51626499,90220330,"ouu! I really want this, but my code work like this  - https://imgur.com/a/9dRUfgI"
51627194,51626499,90220411,Show your code where you're calling it and how you're using it. Your alert isn't showing here. Are you getting any error in logs?
51627194,51626499,90220464,here are screenshots - https://imgur.com/a/YtLY8qq
51627194,51626499,90220741,"inside `showLoginAlertViewWithTitle` you have added above code, right? I think you don't need `clickButtonAtIndex` here. your code for specific button should be placed inside the block."
51627194,51626499,90221088,"even when I delete that function - clickedButtonIndex - your code still doesnt working, I dont know where could be mistake....Is it possible to use PasteBoard for paste date from other app?"
51627194,51626499,90221309,Can I know where you're presenting this alert? I mean is it on an existing `viewController` or you're using it as standalone alert?
51627194,51626499,90221850,"This Alert shows every-time, when user is logging. So user start App and then this alert shows. And I need, if user has some other app, for example lastpass where he copy password and then he want it to paste it in my app."
51627194,51626499,90222122,You need a `view controller` say `mainViewController` then in `viewDidAppear` you can call this alert OR you can try this https://stackoverflow.com/a/35672915/5622566 for this you need to replace `self` in `[self presentViewController:alertController animated:YES completion:nil];` with `rootcontroller` of app.
51627194,51626499,90222171,"Related to copy paste, Yes you can use `PasteBoard` but it is also deprecated in iOS 10 and from then it'll be handled implicitly so I don't think you need this now"
51627194,51626499,90222337,RootController is not working - it is showing me an error.
51627194,51626499,90222712,"what will change if I change first row to this - ""- (void) showLoginAlertViewWithTitle:(NSString *)title"""
51627194,51626499,90269886,"today I made some changes in code and now options  like - copy, cut and paste - are shown me. But when I click on paste or copy, nothing happens. It seems me, like that buttons are blocked or cant do what they should... Please do you know, what it could be?"
51627194,51626499,90270743,Try viewHierarchy debugger to debug more... Not sure why it's happening. :|
51748818,51748818,90459203,Don't start with `async`/`await`. Learn about promises and how promisify your callback-taking functions (`pool.query`) first
51748818,51748818,90459239,"Also, beware of SQL injections!"
51749486,51748818,90459582,"Thanks @doowb. I tried the async method. I did a console.log(result.rows) and I get data. But in the UI, all I get is an empty object."
51749486,51748818,90460159,The one with Promise works perfect.
51749486,51748818,90462221,CAn you guide me to fix the async/await issue?
51749486,51748818,90468647,"you might not have an issue if your data is coming back fine. It's hard for me to tell, but the answer I gave is how you would use `async/await` and promises together instead of the callbacks. (btw... i didn't see your comments earlier because I didn't get notifications from SO until just now)"
51749486,51748818,90468728,"Yeah, the data comes back fine. I am able to log it and see the data. But in the UI, all I can see is an empty object. As you said, rows query might get returned before counts query and that might be the thing."
51749486,51748818,90468926,I added a 3rd code block with how I would personally handle that query. It might show your data now.
51749486,51748818,90469114,"The reason why I have two queries is because I have a limit clause in the main query and I need the counts query to get me the total count for pagination. In this case, since I only fetch 5 at a time, it wouldnt work I guess."
51749486,51748818,90475570,"oh, there isn't a limit clause in the one in the example code so I missed that part. In that case, if you want to run them in parallel, move all of the `totalItem` based property calculations to the `count` function (like `firstItem` and `lastItem`) and remove them from the `rows` function. The will keep the resulting data calcuations independent and allow it to run in parallel."
51749486,51748818,90476630,Tried that too. Looks like result is sent in the response even before the data from the database is returned and is an empty object. Is there a specific place I should put my response.json?
